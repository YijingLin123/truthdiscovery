(Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today. Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.99) to be 27%.

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside As of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74. See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside. The projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77. Agilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend On November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share. At the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235). The current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is an increase of 30 owner(s) or 1.57% in the last quarter.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised. There are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779. But the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Notably, Agilent enhanced the BioTek Cytation C10 confocal imaging reader with the addition of water immersion and confocal spinning disk technology. Further, the water immersion technology can be used in light microscopy to increase numerical aperture, reduce z-axis distortion, and improve image quality by placing water between the objective lens and sample. Additionally, the technology aids researchers in reducing exposure times in live-cell applications, thereby reducing the traditional phototoxic effects associated with these experiments. Moreover, this addition offers a deep-sectioning spinning disk technology, enhancing microscopic images by blocking out-of-focus light, resulting in clearer, more quantitative results. Agilent is anticipated to gain significant traction among researchers utilizing live-cell and 3D applications on the back of its latest move. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Growth Prospects The latest move positions the company well to strengthen its footing in the global microplate reader and live cell imaging markets. Per a Grand View Research report, the global microplate reader market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period 2023-2030. A Mordor Intelligence report indicates the global live cell imaging market size will reach $2.95 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.06% between 2023 and 2028. We believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock. However, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions. Agilent has lost 13.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 0.9%. ACG Segment in Focus The latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) segment. Notably, Agilent Technologies launched Gen6 software for all Agilent BioTek detection instruments, offering automated optimization tools and improved navigation through built-in data analysis functions. Further, the company introduced the Agilent BioTek 406 FX washer dispenser, a compact tool that combines reagent dispensing and plate-washing, suitable for automated systems and benchtop use. All the abovementioned endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the ACG segment in the days ahead. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the ACG segment revenues increased 6% year over year to $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. Our model projects fiscal 2024 ACG segment revenues at $1.64 billion, indicating growth of 4.7% from 2022. Strong momentum in the underlined segment will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper ""Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis"" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Marriott International, Inc. and Parker-Hannifin Corp.

You can see all of today's research reports here >>> Visa's shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company's stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth. The fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance. (You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>) Shares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company's upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends. Also, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well. During the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days. (You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>) Shares ofParker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment. Higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company's Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin's margins. The company's measures to add shareholder value hold promise. However, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH's top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.

These biotech companies are not only doing the job, but also have potential for future growth. Let’s take a quick look at these biotech stocks to buy. Agilent (A) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is a key player in the life sciences industry, providing vital solutions for laboratories and research facilities. Although it is not a traditional biotech company, its impact on the biotech and healthcare sectors is notable. In their recent third quarter report, they faced a 2.7% decline in year-on-year revenues, reflecting weaker market conditions. However, the company demonstrated its resilience, showing a 7% increase in non-GAAP net income. Despite these challenges, Agilent adjusted its outlook for the year, anticipating a 0.7% decline to flat growth. One positive aspect of the report is Agilent’s commitment to shareholders, as evidenced by the 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, reflecting confidence in the company’s financial position. This move may appeal to investors looking for stable returns. On the biotech front, they received FDA approval for their PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx as a diagnostic tool. This approval is crucial for identifying patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA, an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK). The significance lies in the fact that PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic for this purpose, demonstrating Agilent’s leadership in the development of companion diagnostics. Exact Sciences (EXAS) Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) stands out as a key player in the field of cancer detection and diagnostics, attracting the attention of investors seeking innovative opportunities. Its recent financial report for the third quarter of 2023 reveals impressive growth, with total revenues of $628 million, a significant 20% increase over the same period last year. Core revenues, excluding exceptionals, showed an even more remarkable increase of 23%, driven by a 31% increase in the Screening segment and a 3% increase in Precision Oncology revenues. In particular, Exact Sciences made waves with the groundbreaking BLUE-C assay results presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. The next-generation Cologuard test showed an exceptional sensitivity of 94% for colorectal cancer with a specificity of 91%, outperforming fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) in detecting cancer or pre-cancer. In addition, the test demonstrated higher sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions compared to FIT. Beyond the financial success, they showed their commitment to advancing cancer detection and treatment at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2023. The company presented data on its blood-based early detection program for multiple cancers and results from OncoExTra, which provides information on actionable fusions in people with solid tumors. Soleno Therapeutics (SLNO) Source: aslysun / Shutterstock.com Soleno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLNO) is like a medical beacon working passionately in the field of rare diseases. Its flagship, diazoxide choline extended-release tablets (DCCR), has recently achieved great success in the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In a long-term study, DCCR showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo, bringing hope and good vibes to those suffering from this difficult syndrome. What is even more encouraging is that DCCR is not only effective, but also a good teammate, as it is generally well tolerated and has no unexpected safety issues. These findings, presented at the Prader-Willi Research Foundation Symposium, are like a victory cheer for both the scientific community and the individuals and families affected by PWS. But these are not just victories on the medical front. Soleno, as a company, is making strategic moves on the financial front. Closing a round of funding to the tune of $129 million is like giving a strong dose of energy to their research and development efforts. They have even welcomed new members to their board, such as industry veteran Matthew Pauls, and added Dr. Mike Huang to their clinical development team. Looking at their playbook, Soleno is not slowing down. They have published results, are making financial moves, and with an NDA submission for DCCR on the horizon, it looks like they are gearing up for a groundbreaking chapter in their journey to make a meaningful impact on rare diseases.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR) and Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today’s research reports here >>> Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company’s stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth. The fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance. (You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>) Shares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company’s upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends. Also, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well. During the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days. (You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>) Shares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment. Higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise. However, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH’s top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.

The bottom line decreased 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $1.69 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 billion. However, the top line was down 8.7% on a reported basis and 9.7% on a core basis from the respective year-ago levels. The decline was attributed to broad-based weakness across all the end markets, especially in Chemistry & Advanced Materials, Pharma, Food and Diagnostics and Clinical markets. Also, weak momentum in China was a major concern. The company witnessed a year-over-year decline of 31% in its business in China in the reported quarter. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Segmental Top-Line Details Agilent has three reporting segments, namely, Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (“LSAG”), Agilent Cross Lab Group (“ACG”) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (“DGG”). LSAG: The segment accounted for $928 million or 55% of its total revenues, down 17% on a reported basis and 18% on a core basis from the respective prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. This was due to macroeconomic uncertainties, soft market conditions in China and sluggish capital spending by the customers. The reported figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $925 million. ACG: Revenues from the segment were $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $401 million. The top line improved by 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading on a reported basis and by 4% on a core basis, demonstrating solid momentum across all end markets and regions except China. DGG: Revenues increased 1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported basis to $356 million, accounting for the remaining 21% of total revenues. The figure remained flat year over year on a core basis. The figure came above the consensus mark of $345 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business. However, weakness in the genomics business was a negative. Operating Results For the fiscal fourth quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 59.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 180 bps to 50.4%. DGG’s gross margin expanded by 90 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 51.9%.

As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses expanded by 40 bps year over year to 6.8%. SG&A expenses expanded by 50 bps year over year to 23.3%. Operating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 24.2%, which declined 130 bps from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure. Segment-wise, the operating margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 460 bps to 28.1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 430 bps to 31.7%.

Agilent generated $516 million in cash from operations during the reported quarter, down from $562 million generated in the previous quarter. The company made dividend payments worth $66 million and repurchased shares worth $80 million during the fiscal fourth quarter. Guidance For the fiscal first quarter of 2024, management expects revenues of $1.555-$1.605 billion, suggesting a decline between 11.4% and 8.6% on a reported basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals.

VIDEO: Daily Dividend Report: CSCO,CB,EXR,NOC,A,PHM The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Agilent Technologies A is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 20. For the fiscal fourth quarter, A expects revenues of $1.655-$1.705 billion, suggesting a decline between 12.2% and 9.5% on a core basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.67 billion, implying a decline of 9.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Agilent’s non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.33-$1.36 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.34 per share, indicating a fall of 12.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Agilent’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same once, the average being 4.76%. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Factors to Note The company is expected to have gained from growing momentum across Agilent’s Cross Lab Group (“ACG”) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (“DGG”) segments during the fiscal fourth quarter. The ACG segment is likely to have benefited from robust portfolio offerings. Strength in services and solid momentum across all regions and end markets are likely to have contributed well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACG is pegged at $401 million, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Agilent’s strength in the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business is expected to have continued benefiting the DGG segment’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, solid demand for diagnostic tests is expected to have aided the performance of the company’s pathology business. However, weakness in genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses might have been a negative The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DGG is pegged at $345 million, implying a fall of 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Strength in liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and lab consumables is expected to have benefited Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (“LSAG”) segment in the quarter under review. However, the weakening pharma market, macroeconomic uncertainties and soft market conditions in China are likely to have scaled down the LSAG segment’s revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LSAG is pegged at $925 million, implying a decline of 17.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Agilent Technologies A is leaving no stone unturned to bolster diagnostic tool offerings in a bid to strengthen its Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) segment. Notably, Agilent received FDA approval for its PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic tool, which helps in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Further, it identifies patients’ eligibility for treatment with KEYTRUDA, an anti-programmed cell death (PD1) therapy, along with chemotherapy, trastuzumab and fluoropyrimidine. Additionally, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx aids in identifying patients with non-small cell lung, esophageal, cervical, head and neck and triple-negative breast cancer who may be eligible for KEYTRUDA treatment. We note that this approval would benefit cancer patients whose tumors express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Growth Prospects The latest announcement bodes well for the company’s deepening focus to strengthen its footprint in the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market. This, in turn, will aid Agilent to solidify its footing in the global cancer diagnostics market. Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market is expected to hit $45.8 billion in 2023 and reach $104.6 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 18% between 2023 and 2028. A Future Market Insights report indicates that the global cancer diagnostics market will reach $126 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2033. We believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock. However, it has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions. Agilent has lost 24.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s decline of 4.6%. Expanding DGG Segment Apart from the latest move, Agilent released the enhanced xCELLigence RTCA Software Pro Version 2.8, a software package for real-time cell analysis in GMP-regulated facilities, ensuring data authenticity and compliance. Further, Agilent launched the Agilent SureSelect Cancer CGP Assay, a pan-cancer assay designed for somatic variant profiling of solid tumor types, utilizing an NGS panel of 679 genes. We note that all the above-mentioned endeavors will likely act as a catalyst for its customer base expansion. Notably, Agilent signed a Research Collaboration Agreement with the National Cancer Centre Singapore to expedite translational cancer research on Asian-prevalent cancer genomics over two years. Further, the agreement involves the provision of an Agilent Magnis NGS Preparation System for investigating specific details in Asian cancer cohorts, where tissue samples are limited locally and regionally. Moreover, Agilent signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore, to install and operate its xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer, aiming to advance cell and gene therapy over the next three years. All these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the DGG segment in the days ahead. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues in the underlined segment increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million. Our model estimate for DGG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating growth of 1.5% from the 2022 level. The same for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 stands at $1.48 billion and $1.58 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 5% and 7%, respectively. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Salesforce CRM. While Badger Meter sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Salesforce carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%. Revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent? For Agilent, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.53%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Agilent will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.43, delivering a surprise of +4.38%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Agilent doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

While Ametek has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

The diagnostics unit, which makes kits, also used for COVID-19 testing, as well as reagents and other tools, reported sales of $2.25 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.12 billion, according to LSEG data. However, the life sciences unit, which provides reagents and lab equipment used in the discovery of new drugs and vaccines, posted sales of $1.71 billion, missing estimates of $1.78 billion. ""Revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations, with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher respiratory testing revenue more than offsetting slightly softer-than-anticipated demand in Life Sciences,"" Danaher CEO Rainer Blair said in a statement. Shares of the Washington D.C.-based company rose 1.2% to $206.50 before the bell. Danaher now expects a slight decline in adjusted core sales for the year, compared with its previous expectation of a low single-digit rise. Life sciences companies such as Danaher, Agilent A.N and Thermo Fisher TMO.N cut their annual profit forecasts earlier this year as some clients slashed their budgets for biopharma services due to a funding crunch. Rising interest rates squeezed funding needed for drug development programs, weighing on demand for contract research services offered by Danaher and rival Thermo Fisher.

(Symbol: A) saw new options become available today, for the December 15th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.75. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $102.25 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $109.28/share today. Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.62% return on the cash commitment, or 16.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $109.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.78% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $109.28) to be 27%.

The publicly available version of the complaint did not contain further details, but Icahn told the 13D investor conference in New York on Tuesday that the lawsuit pertained to Illumina completing its acquisition of cancer detection test maker Grail. Illumina said it is reviewing the complaint, while Icahn and Grail did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for a comment. The gene-sequencing machine maker had repurchased Grail in 2021 despite opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators - a decision that prompted Icahn to pursue a proxy fight at Illumina, arguing Grail should be divested as it had cost investors billions of dollars. Last week, Illumina said it would divest cancer test maker Grail in 12 months according to the terms of the European Commission's order, if the life sciences company does not win its challenge in court.

Notably, Agilent's 6475 LC/MS, which utilizes iFunnel technologies, will aid SIDC's research on tropical medicines and infectious diseases, enabling rapid outbreak response through extensive research and diagnostic capabilities. Further, the 6475 LC/MS system enhances signal response and optimizes research outcomes through technology and knowledge transfer, capacity building, research programs and human capital development. SIDC plans to use Agilent's capabilities as it prepares for facility completion by December 2025. We note that the latest move has expanded the customer base of Agilent’s liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) systems. This, in turn, will strengthen Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment. Moreover, the deal will also strengthen Agilent’s footprint in Asian markets. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Growth Prospects We believe that the latest move will strengthen the company’s footing in the global neglected tropical diseases diagnosis market. Per an MMR research report, the global NTD diagnosis market size is expected to reach $8.97 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.5% between 2022 and 2029. A Grand View Research report predicts the global NTD diagnosis market size to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2030. We believe the company’s solid prospects in the promising NTD diagnosis market are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock. However, it has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions. Agilent has lost 25.6% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s growth of 0.8%. LSAG Segment in Focus The latest move is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its LSAG segment. Apart from the latest move, Agilent Technologies showcased its expanded InfinityLab GPC/SEC Solution at the HPLC Conference 2023 in Düsseldorf. The solution includes a dedicated column thermostat, multi-angle light scattering detector, GPC/SEC-Ready Kit, and WinGPC Software for advanced material characterization. Additionally, Agilent's 1260 Infinity II Hybrid Multisampler, 1290 Infinity II Bio Online Sample Manager and Revident Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS System were also displayed at the HPLC 2023 conference. Further, Agilent Technologies introduced new liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems, Agilent 6495D LC/TQ and Revident LC/Q-TOF, along with new software for profiling and library management, ensuring high analytical sensitivity and efficiency for fast, high-quality data and early maintenance feedback for optimal performance. Also, Agilent launched the Agilent 8697 Headspace Sampler -XL Tray, offering 120 vial capacity and enhanced instrument intelligence features for increased uptime and operator ease of use compared to its predecessor. All these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the LSAG segment in the days ahead. However, the sluggish pharma market continues to remain a concern. Our model estimate for LSAG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $3.85 billion, indicating a decline of 3.9% from the fiscal 2022 level.

The Federal Reserve’s aggressive posture against inflation combined with soaring interest rates have investors taking defensive measures. But it’s not time to give up on the stock market. In fact, thanks to the recent selling, bargains are springing up across many S&P 500 stocks. Let’s examine three that will benefit from current market conditions and rally heading into 2024. Wells Fargo (WFC) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the big banks that is thriving amid the industry’s correction. That’s because Wells Fargo did not aggressively expand its balance sheet or buy overvalued securities over the past few years. True, investors have shunned nearly all financials stocks this year amid unprecedented volatility in the interest rate markets. Banks that were positioned poorly, like First Republic and Silicon Valley, ended up going bust. And others are suffering from falling profitability and strained balance sheets at the present time. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has positioned its balance sheet to earn far more profits as interest rates rise. And those rates are normally beneficial to the banking sector as a whole. For firms like Wells Fargo that managed their risks and exposures properly, that remains true in 2023. Specifically, Wells Fargo’s net interest margin (NIM), the spread between its loan interest and deposit payments, has soared from 2.2% in Q2 of last year to 3.1% today. With a near 50% jump in core profitability on its loan book, it’s no wonder that Wells Fargo is reporting rising earnings. WFC stock hasn’t yet snapped out of the industrywide doldrums. As a result, shares go for just eight times forward earnings today. Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Charles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) is a leading healthcare company focused on providing lab tools and services related to pharmaceutical drug development. Historically, it’s been the dominant player in animal models. Specifically, Charles River procures, breeds, and distributes lab rats, mice, rabbits, and non-human primates. The last one got Charles River in trouble, as the company was implicated in an investigation into alleged macaque smuggling in Cambodia. However, as of last quarter, Charles River has been able to resolve its sourcing issues around non-human primates. More broadly, CRL stock has slumped amid the slowdown in the biotech industry. With smaller biotech companies struggling to obtain funding, Charles River is experiencing less trials and revenue-generating business. Yet, it’s only a matter of time until biotech funding rises again, given the priority to find cures for rare diseases. CRL will inevitably be part of those future cures. In fact, the company was involved in developing more than 80% of all drugs that received FDA approval since 2020. In effect, Charles River is a tax on the entire biotech industry, with their consistent postings of compounded earnings per share growth rate in the teens since the turn of the century. Thanks to the recent scandal and biotech industry’s slump, CRL shares are now on sale at an unusually low 18 times forward earnings. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) Source: Funtap / Shutterstock.com Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) is a company that provides testing, product quality, and design solutions to technology companies. The firm has an interesting history. Keysight sprung up originally as Hewlett-Packard‘s Test & Measurement division more than half a century ago, and was ultimately spun off from Agilent (NYSE:A) into its own publicly-traded entity in 2014. KEYS stock has been incredibly successful over the past decade. Since 2014, shares jumped from $30 to a peak of more than $200. However, Keysight has fallen amid a slowdown in telecom and information technology spending over the past year. That has led KEYS stock to slide back to around $130 today. The weakness makes sense, as Keysight is heavily involved in quality control and testing for telecom companies. With 5G rollouts seeing an underwhelming debut as compared to expectations, that has cast a shadow on industry vendors. Other Keysight segments such as services for edge computing and RFID functions have slipped as demand levels off following an unusually robust 2021 and 2022. Indeed, the market is blowing the situation way out of proportion. KEYS stock is down to 16 times forward earnings, which is quite the discount for a tech company that has reliably posted double-digit earnings growth. It’s only a matter of time until telecom spending picks back up given the ever-growing demand for mobile data. Also, Keysight is active in emerging growth fields such as AI and next-generation semiconductors. Investors should take advantage of the current dip in KEYS stock.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In trading on Thursday, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 26.2, after changing hands as low as $109.905 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 33.9. A bullish investor could look at A's 26.2 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of A shares: Looking at the chart above, A's low point in its 52 week range is $109 per share, with $160.265 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $110.56.

The research focuses on improving tumor genome characterization and utilizing this data in patient care to enhance clinical trials, oncology diagnostics and treatment decisions. Notably, this collaboration involves the provision of the Agilent Magnis NGS Preparation System, which is used to study details specific to Asian cancer cohorts where tissue samples are limited. This, in turn, will simplify gene assays and complex genetic aberrations for reproducible results. We believe that the latest agreement will accelerate the development of next-generation diagnostic tools to improve patient care. Moreover, the deal will also strengthen Agilent’s footprint in Asian markets. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Growth Prospects The latest partnership is in sync with the company’s efforts to strengthen its footprint in the global genomics market. Per a Towards Healthcare report, the global genomics market is expected to reach $127.16 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 16.1% between 2023 and 2032. A Grand View Research report predicts the global genomics market to witness a CAGR of 16.5% during the period of 2023-2030. We believe the company’s solid prospects in the promising genomics market are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock. Agilent has lost 25% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 1.7%. Notably, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions. DGG Segment in Focus The latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) segment. Recently, Agilent released the enhanced xCELLigence RTCA Software Pro Version 2.8, a software package for real-time cell analysis in GMP-regulated facilities, ensuring data authenticity and compliance. Further, it launched the Agilent SureSelect Cancer CGP Assay, a pan-cancer assay designed for somatic variant profiling of solid tumor types, utilizing an NGS panel of 679 genes. We note that the abovementioned endeavors will likely act as a catalyst for its customer base expansion. Notably, Agilent signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore to install and operate its xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer, aiming to advance cell and gene therapy over the next three years The company also partnered with Theragen Bio to improve precision oncology in South Korea through advanced bioinformatic solutions, leveraging their combined expertise in cancer genomic profiling design and software knowledge. All these endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the DGG segment in the days ahead. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues in the underlined segment increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported, as well as a core basis to $349 million. Our model estimate for DGG revenues for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating growth of 1.5% from the 2022 level. The same for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 stands at $1.48 billion and $1.58 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5% and 7%, respectively.

Shares have lost about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Agilent due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Agilent Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates Agilent Technologies delivered third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $1.43 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%. The bottom line increased by 7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. Revenues of $1.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion. However, the top line was down 2.7% on a reported basis and 2.3% on a core basis from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was attributed to sluggishness in Chemistry & Advanced Materials and Pharma & Biopharma markets due to weak momentum in China. Nevertheless, growth in Academia & Gov’t, Food, Environmental & Forensics and Diagnostics and Clinical markets remained a positive. Segmental Top Line Details Agilent has three reporting segments, namely, Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG). LSAG: The segment accounted for $927 million or 55% of its total revenues, down 9% on a reported as well as on a core basis from the respective prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. This was due to macroeconomic uncertainties, soft market conditions in China and a sluggish pharma market. The reported figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $929 million. ACG: Revenues from the segment were $396 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $377 million. The top line improved by 10% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading on a reported basis and by 11% on a core basis, demonstrating solid momentum across all regions and end markets. A strong demand for the company’s services was a positive. DGG: Revenues increased 3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure on a reported as well as a core basis to $349 million, accounting for the remaining 21% of total revenues. The figure came slightly below the consensus mark of $3508 million. Segmental growth was attributed to strength in the NASD business. A solid demand for diagnostic tests contributed well to the company’s pathology business. However, weakness in genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses was a negative. Operating Results For the fiscal third quarter, gross margin in the LSAG segment contracted by 50 basis points (bps) to 29.9% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. ACG’s gross margin expanded by 390 bps to 50.9%. DGG’s gross margin contracted by 180 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals to 52.2%. Research & development (R&D) costs were $118 million, up 1.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s number. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $407 million, down 1.2% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses expanded by 35 bps year over year to 7.05%. SG&A expenses expanded by 40 bps year over year to 24.3%. Operating margin for the fiscal third quarter was 7.9%, which declined significantly from 23.9% in the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s figure. Segment-wise, the operating margin for LSAG was down 60 bps from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s level of 29.9%. ACG’s operating margin was 32.7%, up 810 bps from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. DGG segment’s operating margin expanded 250 bps to 24% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s figure. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow As of Jul 31, 2023, Agilent’s cash and cash equivalents were $1.33 billion, up from $1.18 billion on Apr 30, 2023. Accounts receivables were $1.3 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023, down from $1.4 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023. Long-term debt was $2.734 billion for the reported quarter compared with $2.733 billion in the prior fiscal quarter. Agilent generated $562 million in cash from operations during the reported quarter, up from $398 million generated in the previous quarter. It returned $401 million to shareholders, out of which dividend payments accounted for $66 million and share repurchases accounted for the remaining $335 million. Guidance For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, management expects revenues of $1.655-$1.705 billion, suggesting a decline between 12.2% and 9.5% on a core basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be $1.33-$1.36. For fiscal 2023, management lowered its revenue guidance to the band of $6.80-$6.85 billion from $6.93-7.03 billion, implying growth of 0.8-1.5% on a core basis from the respective fiscal 2022 figures. Management also lowered the guidance for fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share downward from $5.60-$5.65 to $5.40-5.43. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month. The consensus estimate has shifted -16.1% due to these changes. VGM Scores At this time, Agilent has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Outlook Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Agilent has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months. 4 Oil Stocks with Massive Upsides Global demand for oil is through the roof... and oil producers are struggling to keep up.

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think?

Given the way analysts feel about Agilent right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Looking to Trade Options?

Consider that the investment world has its own version of these concealed treasures: Spinoffs. These financial treasures have the potential to reshape your entire investment voyage, not just enhance your portfolio. The catch? You must look for them and do some work. A tough ask, I know. What is A Spinoff? In a Spinoff, a parent company separates one of its business entities or divisions into a standalone, independent company. By distributing shares of the spun-off company to the current proprietors of the parent, two separate publicly listed entities are created. The new enterprise that emerges because of a Spinoff is often referred to as a ""Spinoff company."" Spinoffs can increase shareholder value by allowing distinct companies to focus on their core competencies and releasing hidden value in specific business divisions. In addition, it offers investors the option to invest in various companies based on their investment preferences and risk tolerance. Or, alternatively, eradicate them. The media frequently gets it wrong when speaking about Spinoffs. This is a very important point to remember. A ‘true’ Spinoff only happens when a share of a division is distributed amongst existing shareholders that own the parent company. Contrary to the media, IPOs, Divestitures, carve-outs, split-offs, and split-ups are not Spinoffs and consequently, these transactions lose many of the value creating dynamics of the Spinoff corporate action. Cross-reference information from various trustworthy sources, particularly official business communication. To fully comprehend the Spinoff and its ramifications, investors should also look for information from reliable financial analysts, subject-matter experts, and formal regulatory filings, such as those with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Do Spinoffs Outperform? The “Spinoff” is an essentially inefficient method for distributing stock to the incorrect individuals. You receive shares whether you desire them or not. Typically, investors acquire these shares by default and sell them on the open market almost immediately, making them inexpensive companies that no one is interested in. They are occasionally referred to as ""orphan securities."" At this point, X marks the location, and digging should commence. Why the dynamics of Spinoffs make it an essential area for an investor to analyze: Studies have shown that Spinoffs have historically beaten the market by over 10 percent as the pure, newly focused business takes off. Compensation for executives can be more closely correlated with business performance. The company will become smaller, which will increase the executives' motivation and sense of ownership. Separating companies allows each entity to be properly valued and can sometimes unlock a “conglomerate discount."" Due to the likelihood that the company would be small and lack a roadshow, it is under-followed. As a result, there are more chances for investors to discover returns greater than the index. The Edge Consulting Groups 20 year study shows that Spinoffs are likely to be taken over. Roughly 35 percent are acquired around the two-year mark post-Spinoff. Typically, there are hundreds of Spinoff situations a year. Around 40 have over $1 billion in market cap. This is a sweet spot where liquidity and “real” companies come together in my opinion. 5 Reasons Why You Should Be Looking For These Situations Including Spinoffs in your investment portfolio can provide a variety of benefits, including diversification, undervalued opportunities, and the potential for higher returns and enhanced performance. 1. Enhanced Diversification: Incorporating Spinoffs introduces a new layer of diversification. Since Spinoff companies often operate in different sectors than their parent companies, they can provide exposure to industries that might not have been represented in your portfolio. This helps spread risk and reduces the impact of negative events within a specific sector. 2. Undervalued Opportunities: Spinoffs are sometimes overlooked by the market, leading to potential undervaluation. This presents an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of promising companies at a lower price compared to their intrinsic value. As the market gradually recognizes their worth, these undervalued gems can yield substantial returns. 3. Focused Management: Spinoff companies can streamline operations and focus on their core competencies, which often leads to improved efficiency and performance. The management teams of these newly independent entities tend to be more agile and dedicated to the success of their specific business, potentially translating into better growth prospects. 4. Catalyst for Change: The newfound independence of a Spinoff can lead to strategic changes, such as cost-cutting initiatives, innovation, and targeted expansion plans. These changes can drive improved financial performance and boost shareholder value over time. 5. Potential for Outperformance: Historical data indicates that Spinoffs often outperform the broader market indices. This outperformance can be attributed to a combination of factors, including improved focus, better capital allocation decisions, and the market's eventual recognition of the Spinoff's value proposition. Why isn’t Everybody Looking At Them? I asked the legendary investor Joel Greenblatt this question once and he didn’t hesitate to give me the answer. ‘No one wants to do the work.’ Spinoffs analysis takes a lot of effort and, surprise, surprise, not many want to do it. However, as an investment veteran of over 30 years, I can categorically say that some of my most profitable ideas come from doing a hell of a lot of work and finding the angle and edge in the situation in this area. Furthermore, they are not promoted by brokers. Unlike an IPO there is no stock to sell you. You gain the Spinoff from holding the parent company whether you like it or not. This opens a whole range of dynamics that are interesting for investing. Recent Spinoffs That You May Know AbbVie (ABBV) (formerly known as Abbott Laboratories' biopharmaceutical business) was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. AbbVie has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff. Visa (V) was spun off from Bank of America (BAC) in 2008. Visa has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 400% since Spinoff. Mastercard (MA) was spun off from American Express (AXP) in 2006. Mastercard has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 300% since Spinoff. Agilent Technologies (A) was spun off from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in 1999. Agilent Technologies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 200% since the spinoff. Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Life Sciences division was spun off as a separate company called Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies in 2017. Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 50% since the spinoff. These are just a few examples of successful stock Spinoffs. There are many other examples, and the success of a spinoff can vary depending on several factors, such as the underlying business, the management team, and the market condition. In Summary If you are after hidden value where no one else is looking, look no further than this area of the market. There are services out there that can help, but ultimately a little hard work in a proven area will get you to some positive wealth creation a lot faster than competing with the masses.

Abcam believes that Danaher's all-cash offer is superior to a rival bid from Agilent Technologies Inc A.N, the sources said. The exact price that Danaher is offering could not be learned. One of the sources said the deal price would be close to Abcam's current valuation, given that its stock has already risen more than 20% after Bloomberg News reported on June 16 that the company was fielding takeover interest. If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement is certain and that the outcome could still change. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Abcam, Danaher and Agilent did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Abcam shares rose as much as 9% in afternoon trading in New York on Friday to $24.52. Danaher shares were up 1.3% at $256.76. Based in Cambridge, England, Abcam supplies antibodies, reagents and other products used in medical research. The company serves roughly 750,000 research scientists at academic, research, government and biopharmaceutical organizations. Abcam has come under pressure from activist shareholders to sell itself, including its founder Jonathan Milner who owns 6.1% of the company, as well as hedge fund Starboard Value LP, complaining about the company's stock underperforming for most of the last two years. Danaher, one of the world's largest suppliers of diagnostic tools with a market value of $190 billion, has turned to dealmaking to expand in the sector. Abcam's antibody and reagent solutions could help Danaher win more and bigger contracts with some customers. Danaher acquired General Electric Co's GE.N biopharma solution business for $21.4 billion in 2019 and contract development and manufacturing organization Aldevron for $9.6 billion in 2021.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq 100 were down 2,1%, 2.0%, and 2.4%, respectively, for the week of Aug. 14-18. Barron’s believes that September could be worse. If the past week is any indication, they could be on to something. Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee thinks August has been its typical mercurial self where gains are hard to come by and that the good times should return soon. Baron’s reported Lee’s comments from his Aug. 18 note to clients: “[T]he month’s declines haven’t shaken Lee’s core bullish thesis. ‘We see this more as ‘it’s August’ rather than the start of a larger rout…we are not in the camp this spills over into a wider selloff. That could happen, but more bad things need to emerge. In fact, there are some signs that we could see the stocks begin to stabilize soon.’” So, if you’re a risk-averse investor, you might want to wait a couple of weeks to see if the markets bottom. In the meantime, a quick screen of S&P 500 stocks down more than 20% over the past month gives bargain-hunting investors 14 stocks to choose from. Here are three undervalued due to their 20%, including one name from three different sectors. Sealed Air (SEE) Source: Shutterstock Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) represents the materials sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 31% year-to-date. Analysts are moderately optimistic about the stock, with 7 of the 15 rating it as Overweight or an outright Buy. It’s target price is $45 which is 31% higher than its current share price. One of the things that I use to assess value is free cash flow yield. If it’s over 8%, it’s definitely value. Between 4% and 8%, it’s reasonable value, if not dirt cheap. In the trailing 12 months ended June 30, its free cash flow was $152 million. Based on an enterprise value of $9.78 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.6%, which suggests it’s not cheap. Before you toss the company best known for bubble wrap packaging overboard, consider its historical FCF yield. In 2020, it had a free cash flow of $556 million. Based on an enterprise value of $10.6 billion. At first glance, it appears Sealed Air’s business has deteriorated. And to a certain extent, it has, which is why it’s moving forwqard with SEE 2.0. This revitalization plan should deliver $150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2025 and a return to its historical earnings and sales growth in 2024. Its stock hasn’t been this low since June 2020. Get ready for a revival in the waning months of 2023 and into 2024. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) Source: fantasyform/Shutterstock.com Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) represents the tech sector. Its stock is down 23% for the past month and 24% year-to-date. Like Sealed Air, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020. Keysight is a relatively new company by S&P 500 standards, incorporated in 2013. However, its history dates back to 1939 and Hewlett-Packard’s founding by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. Their first product was an audio oscillator. Electronic measurement was their business. In 1999, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) was formed to operate HP’s Medical Products and Instrument Group. In 2013, Agilent was split into two pure-play electronic measurement companies. Keysight was the one of the two, going public on November 1, 2014 after separating from Agilent. Agilent shareholders got one share of Keysight for two held by the parent. KEYS stock is up 335% since it began trading in November 2014. Agilent is up 191% over the same period. Shares have lost their mojo recently because the company reported Q3 2023 results on August 18th that included a downward revision of its guidance. It now expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to decline by 10% and 13%, respectively. Currently trading at 4.16x sales — less than its five-year average of 5.1x — its enterprise value of $22.5 billion is 12.87x its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That’s lower than it’s been since 2016. ResMed (RMD) Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock ResMed (NYSE:RMD) represents the healthcare sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 21% year-to-date. Like the other two, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020. Interestingly, ResMed’s business is probably doing the best in terms of top-line growth among the trio, up 23% in Q4 2023 and 18% for all of 2023 to $4.2 billion. However, investors began to abandon the stock after hearing its gross margin (56.5%) and operating margin (29.0%) dropped for the year. All of its stock losses in 2023 are post-earnings. Investors have rightly or wrongly decided that the contraction of its margins in light of double-digit revenue growth suggests the quality of the sales increase for the maker of sleep apnea equipment is suspect. ResMed CEO Mick Farrell is very confident about the future. He stated in the Q4 2023 conference call: “Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients.” Of the 24 analysts covering the stock, 18 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $240 median price, 45% higher than its current share price. I see ResMed as the best long-term hold of the trio, although all three should make you money over 3-5 years.

The major indexes are either down or flat on the day. Stocks appear headed for their worst week since March. Investors are worried about many subjects, including further interest rate hikes, higher bond yields, and a faltering Chinese economy. While I can’t promise you a rose garden regarding these subjects, I can tell you that it can always be worse. Think March 2009 or March 2020. My task on Fridays is to discuss unusual options activities that I find particularly interesting. The three options that have caught my attention today have one thing in common. By the end, you ought to know what it is. Happy Weekend! Agilent Technologies The first to catch my attention involves selling Agilent Technologies (A) put options. As I write this, one put and one call exhibits unusual options activity. While the call gives you a low ask price, I'm going with the Nov. 17 $115 put. The bid price on this Agilent put is $3.70. Based on a share price of $119.63, we’re looking at an annualized yield of 12.4%. With 91 days to expiry, the volume is 828, or 2.55x open interest. Currently, $4.63 above the strike, there is a real possibility that the put buyer will make you buy the shares at the strike. In that case, you’re not losing money until it falls to $111.30. Over the past year, Agilent stock hasn’t traded that low, with a 52-week low of $113.28. The last time its shares consistently traded below $111 was in late 2020. The odds are good that it might hit $115, but $111.30 is much less likely. I’m no technical analysis guru, but it does appear its shares bottomed in June. I know what you’re thinking: Didn’t the company give its guidance on China concerns? It sure did. On Wednesday, it said it expects revenue of $6.80 billion for its fiscal year, down from its previous guidance of $6.93 billion. On the bottom line, its earnings per share estimate has dropped by 20 cents to $5.40 at the low end of its guidance. There you have it: approximately $130 million less revenue and 20 cents per share. The EPS estimate revision translates to less than a 4% cut in earnings. Currently trading at 22.5x earnings, the maker of lab instruments is in value territory. Having traded near $180 as recently as September 2021, this is a good entry point. Ford Another stock that’s fallen out of favor with investors is Ford (F). Its shares are down 26% over the past year. Investors might be skeptical about its electric vehicle plans. On Aug. 17, it announced that it and a consortium of companies would invest $887 million to build a plant in Becancour, Quebec, to produce EV battery materials. When the plant gets up to speed, it will be capable of producing 45,000 tonnes of cathode active materials (CAM). “This cathode facility will supply the material that goes into Ford’s future EVs in North America, specifically some of our future trucks,” Lisa Drake, Ford vice president for EVs, told reporters. As part of the investment, the Canadian government will make a CAD$322 million condition loan, while the Quebec government will kick in a similar amount on a forgivable basis. The plant’s expected to open in 2026. I mention this because Ford recently reported healthy Q2 2023 earnings of $1.9 billion, a three-fold increase from a year ago. However, the iconic Detroit automaker said its EV business lost $1.1 billion on an EBIT basis during the quarter, more than double its loss in Q2 2022. In 2023, it expects EBIT losses of $4.5 billion, $1.5 billion more than expected. Ford isn’t alone here. Almost every company with a presence in EVs is losing money and ratcheting their production outputs lower to recognize that the uptake by consumers, especially in North America, will be slower than anticipated. As soon as the charging networks are up to snuff in North America, EV production will rocket higher. It will take patience from investors. The put to sell is the Sept. 8 $12 strike with a bid price of $0.38 for a net price of $11.62. That’s an annualized yield of 55.6% should its share price fail to remain under $12 by September. With a 52-week low of $10.90, you aren’t likely to lose much on the trade, even if it falls into the low $11s. Long-term, Ford’s going to be a player in EVs. U.S. Steel The iconic but oft-struggled U.S. steelmaker is possibly in the final throes of being sold to one of its competitors. Who it will be, we still don’t know. However, one thing is sure: U.S. Steel’s (X) final sale price will increase. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) has already offered $35 in cash and stock. That was rejected. Privately held Esmark has also made an unsolicited bid that’s been rejected by the company. Where this goes is anyone’s guess. However, if you sell the Aug. 25 $28.50 put, you’re looking at an annualized yield of almost 20%, with virtually no chance you’ll be asked to buy the shares. Keep selling puts weekly at a sub-$30 strike until the deal is done. Sure, if everything goes away and there is no sale, the stock price could crater into the $20s, but by then, you might have rolled the dice on three or four occasions, pocketing more than enough premium income to account for any decline. Consider this my M&A arbitrage bet. Have you figured out the one thing these three stocks have in common? They all have single-letter stock symbols.

The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 25-26 meeting revealed a split among Fed officials regarding the necessity for further interest rate hikes, as “some participants” voiced concerns about potential economic risks from excessive rate increases, while “most” policymakers continued to prioritize the battle against inflation. Also, during the policy outlook discussion, officials emphasized the significance of closely observing incoming economic data “to determine the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time.” “Most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy,” according to the FOMC minutes released Wednesday. “The FOMC minutes reiterated many of the core themes that Powell delivered at the July press conference. There was nothing here to derail our assumption that September will be another ‘skip,’ although another hike in November or December is firmly on the table if the data warrants,” said Ben Jeffery, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets. In Wednesday’s trading session, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped to a 5-week low, the blue-chip Dow posted a 4-week low, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 notched a 1-1/2 month low.

On the bearish side, chip stocks retreated after the 10-year Treasury yield rose to a 9-1/2 month high, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) dropping more than -3% and Marvell Technology (MRVL) slumping over -2%. Also, Agilent Technologies Inc (A) fell more than -3% after cutting its FY23 guidance amid a “softer macroeconomic environment.” Economic data on Wednesday showed U.S. July Building Permits, a proxy for future construction, came in at 1.442M compared to a consensus of 1.463M.

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 14.32% Upside As of August 2, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 143.65. The forecasts range from a low of 116.15 to a high of $171.15. The average price target represents an increase of 14.32% from its latest reported closing price of 125.65. See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside. The projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 1.94%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77. Agilent Technologies Declares $0.22 Dividend On May 17, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share ($0.90 annualized). Shareholders of record as of July 3, 2023 received the payment on July 26, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share. At the current share price of $125.65 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.72%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.73%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.15 (n=235). The current dividend yield is 0.10 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.23. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.25%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1956 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is a decrease of 54 owner(s) or 2.69% in the last quarter.

Gains in silver were limited after JPMorgan Chase and Barclays cut their China 2023 GDP estimates, a bearish factor for industrial metals demand.

Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 14.32% Upside As of August 2, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 143.65. The forecasts range from a low of 116.15 to a high of $171.15. The average price target represents an increase of 14.32% from its latest reported closing price of 125.65. See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside. The projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 1.94%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77. Agilent Technologies Declares $0.22 Dividend On May 17, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share ($0.90 annualized). Shareholders of record as of July 3, 2023 received the payment on July 26, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share. At the current share price of $125.65 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.72%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.73%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.15 (n=235). The current dividend yield is 0.10 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.23. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.25%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1956 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is a decrease of 54 owner(s) or 2.69% in the last quarter.

Stocks this morning are slightly higher. Lower T-note yields and a decline in inflation expectations support stocks today. The 10-year U.S. breakeven inflation rate fell to a 3-1/2 week low today at 2.308%. The markets are awaiting this afternoon’s release of the minutes of the July 25-26 FOMC meeting for clues as to the future direction of Fed policy. This morning’s U.S. economic news was mixed as July housing starts and Jul manufacturing production rose more than expected, but July building permits rose less than expected. China’s economic woes continue to weigh on global markets. The yuan fell to a 9-1/4 month low today, and the Shanghai Composite closed down -0.82% after China’s July home sales fell for the second month by the most in 7 months. Also, liquidity concerns in China’s shadow banking system have intensified after Zhongrong International Trust missed payments on dozens of its investment products. JPMorgan Chase cut its China 2023 GDP forecast to 4.8% from a 6.4% estimate in May. Barclays cut its China 2023 GDP forecast to 4.5% from a prior forecast of 4.9%. Zhongrong International Trust, China's ninth-biggest trust with about 600 billion yuan in assets, missed payments on 30 investment products and halted redemptions on some short-term instruments. The firm said liquidity has dried up ""unexpectedly,"" making it hard to meet short-term debt obligations as most of the underlying assets are long-term and illiquid. The firm has 270 high-yield products totaling 39.5 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) due this year. Weekly data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications fell -0.8% w/w, the fifth straight week of declines.

However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose +0.1% m/m to 1.442 million, weaker than expectations of 1.463 million. U.S. Jul manufacturing production unexpectedly rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of no change. The markets are discounting the odds at 11% for a +25 bp rate hike at the September 20 FOMC meeting and 38% for that +25 bp rate hike at the November 1 FOMC meeting. Global bond yields are mixed. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.0 bp to 4.201%. The 10-year German bund yield is down -2.6 bp at 2.646%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +4.2 bp at 4.631%. Overseas stock markets are lower.

Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) is down more than -7% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after forecasting 2024 EPS of $4.92-$4.99, weaker than the consensus of $5.34. Trucking stocks are under pressure on signs of weakness in freight demand after data from the Cass Freight Shipment Index showed U.S. July freight volume fell -8.9% y/y, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. As a result, JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) is down more than -2%. Also, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings (KNX) and Werner Enterprises (WERN) are down more than -1%.

Across the markets… September 10-year T-notes (ZNU23) today are up +5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -1.0 bp at 4.201%. Sep T-notes today are slightly higher on a decline in inflation expectations after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 3-1/2 week low today at 2.308%. Gains in T-notes are limited due to today’s stronger-than-expected economic news on July housing starts and Jul manufacturing production. The dollar index (DXY00) today is down by -0.06%. The dollar today is slightly weaker, weighed down by lower T-note yields. Also, today’s stronger-than-expected report on Jun Eurozone industrial production boosted the euro against the dollar. Losses in the dollar were contained on weakness in the yuan, which dropped to a 9-1/4 month low against the dollar on Chinese economic concerns. EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is up by +0.16%. The euro is moderately higher today on a weaker dollar. Also, today’s stronger-than-expected report on Eurozone Jun industrial production gave the euro a boost. Eurozone Jun industrial production unexpectedly rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of no change. USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up by +0.16%. The yen today is moving lower for the eighth consecutive session and posted a new 9-month against the dollar. Central bank divergence is weighing on the yen, with the BOE, ECB, and Fed in the middle of their rate hiking cycles while the BOJ maintains QE and record-low interest rates. Lower T-note yields today are limiting losses in the yen. October gold (GCV3) today is up +1.8 (+0.09%), and Sep silver (SIU23) is up +0.064 (+0.28%). Precious metals prices this morning are slightly higher. A weaker dollar today is giving metals prices a boost. Also, T-note yields are supportive of precious metals. In addition, the deepening liquidity crisis in China has boosted safe-haven demand for precious metals after Zhongrong International Trust missed payments on dozens of its investment products. Silver prices are finding support on signs of strength in industrial metals demand after today’s news showed Eurozone Jun industrial production and U.S. Jul manufacturing production rose more than expected. Gains in silver were limited after JPMorgan Chase and Barclays cut their China 2023 GDP estimates, a bearish factor for industrial metals demand. Also, fund liquidation in gold continues after long gold holdings in ETFs fell to a 3-1/3 year low on Tuesday.

After the opening bell, we saw Business Inventories flat month over month and North American Home Builders Confidence drop back down to 50, below the 57 expected and the 56 posted a month ago. Lower housing supply, higher mortgage rates and construction costs, and a depleted construction labor market added to a softening of this confidence survey. In all, the Dow slid -360 points, -1.02%, while the Nasdaq was down -157 points, -1.14%. The S&P 500 was in-line, -1.16% for the session, while the small-cap Russell 2000 fell the furthest of the major indices, -1.29%. For the S&P, the index has slipped beneath its 50-day moving average for the first time in roughly five months. Both the S&P and the Nasdaq currently see their five-month winning streaks in jeopardy halfway through August. H&R Block HRB beat earnings estimates for its fiscal Q4 this afternoon, reporting earnings of $2.05 per share on $1.03 billion which outpaced expectations of $1.89 per share and $1.01 billion, respectively. Full-year revenue guidance was posted at $3.47 billion, ahead of the $3.45 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares of the well-known tax preparation service firm have gained +5.7% on the news. After its stock fell to year-to-date lows around Memorial Day, its now back above breakeven year to date. Agilent Technologies A also released better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3 after today’s close, with earnings of $1.43 per share stepping beyond the $1.37 analysts were expecting (and better than the $1.34 per share reported in the year-ago quarter), and revenues of $1.67 billion squeaking past the $1.66 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, full-year guidance for both earnings and sales came in lower than current estimates in this afternoon’s report, which is likely why shares are trading down -2.1% in late trading. Agilent is down year-to-date by now more than -16%. Tomorrow we get another fairly eventful day, with Housing Starts and Building Permits, as well as Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization, all for the month of July coming out before the opening bell. Wednesday afternoon, we’ll get the minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where interest rates were ratcheted up another 25 basis points after pausing during the FOMC’s June meeting. In the morning, we’ll see Q2 results from Target TGT and after the close Cisco Systems CSCO, both of which are expected to put up big earnings gains from the year-ago quarter.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || For the quarter ended July 2023, Agilent Technologies (A) reported revenue of $1.67 billion, down 2.7% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $1.43, compared to $1.34 in the year-ago quarter. The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion, representing a surprise of +0.92%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +4.38%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $1.37. While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || By Pratik Jain Aug 15 (Reuters) - Medical equipment maker Agilent Technologies A.N cut annual profit and sales forecasts for a second straight quarter as demand stays soft in major market China due to a slow economic recovery. Agilent expects full-year revenue to be between $6.80 billion and $6.85 billion, compared with $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion projected earlier. It expects annual adjusted profit per share between $5.40 and $5.43, compared with its prior forecast of $5.60 to $5.65. ""In July, we saw a further (sales) deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter,"" CFO Robert McMahon said in a post-earnings call. ""While the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4."" For the third quarter ended July 31, the company's total sales fell 2.7% to $1.67 billion. Sales from its third-largest segment that offers genetic sequencing, contract manufacturing, research and development, among others, were $349 million, missing a Refinitiv estimate of $355.67 million. The sales miss was due to softness in genomics and the shutdown of its Resolution Bioscience business, which offered next-generation sequencing-based cancer diagnostics solutions. The company said on Tuesday it has taken a $291 million pre-tax charge in the quarter associated with the shutdown and expects the wind-down to continue through the fourth quarter and into early fiscal 2024. Agilent CEO Mike McMullen flagged performance of its largest unit that provides laboratory instruments, consumables and software continues to be affected by the market environment in China. ""Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases,"" McMullen added. Its quarterly adjusted profit per share was $1.43, above expectations of $1.36.

Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper ""Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis"" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.

For the fiscal third quarter, A expects revenues of $1.640-$1.675 billion, suggesting growth between 4.5% and 2.5% on a core basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.66 billion, implying a decline of 3.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Agilent’s non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.36-$1.38 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.37 per share, indicating growth of 2.2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Agilent’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.58%. Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote Key Factors to Note The company is expected to have gained from growing momentum across Agilent’s Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) segments during the fiscal third quarter. Notably, the ACG segment is likely to have benefited from robust portfolio offerings. Moreover, strength in services attached to new instrument installations, as well as expanding service offerings for the existing instrument base, are likely to have contributed well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACG is pegged at $377 million, implying growth of 5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Further, Agilent’s strength in NASD (Nucleic Acid Solutions Division) business is expected to have continued benefiting the DGG segment’s performance in the fiscal third quarter. Also, solid momentum in the pathology business and companion diagnostics pharma services are likely to have been positives. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DGG is pegged at $350 million, implying growth of 2.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Additionally, strength in liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and lab consumables is expected to have benefited Agilent’s Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment in the quarter under review. However, the weakening of biotech and small molecule businesses is likely to have scaled down the LSAG segment’s revenues in the fiscal third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LSAG is pegged at $929 million, implying a decline of 8.8% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Furthermore, mounting expenses, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation are likely to have remained headwinds in the quarter under review.

(Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 319 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $115.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $127.50/share today. Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.44% return on the cash commitment, or 8.51% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $127.50/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $130.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.94% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $130.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.56% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $127.50) to be 30%.

This compares to earnings of $0.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of 44.44%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Cognex Corporation, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $242.51 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $274.63 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Cognex Corporation shares have added about 8.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.6%. What's Next for Cognex Corporation? While Cognex Corporation has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cognex Corporation: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Also, a weaker-than-expected Jul MNI Chicago PMI report was bullish for T-notes.

The dollar index (DXY00) today is down by -0.06%. The dollar today is slightly lower on strength in the euro after today’s news that the Eurozone Q2 GDP and core CPI rose more than expected.

The BOJ announced that it would buy the equivalent of more than $2 billion of bonds at market rates after the 10-year JGB bond yield climbed to a 9-year high of 0.614%. Bond yields have surged since last Friday when the BOJ tweaked its yield curve control program and effectively raised the upper limit of its 10-year JGB yield target to 1.0% from 0.5%. Today’s Japanese economic news was mixed for the yen. On the negative side, Jun industrial production rose +2.0% m/m, the most in 4 months but weaker than expectations of +2.4% m/m. Conversely, the Jul consumer confidence index rose +0.9 to a 19-month high of 37.2, stronger than expectations of 36.2. Also, Jun retail sales fell -0.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of -0.7% m/m. August gold (GCQ3) today is up +6.5 (+0.33%), and Sep silver (SIU23) is up +0.440 (+1.80%). Precious metals prices this morning are moderately higher. A weaker dollar today is bullish for metals prices. Precious metals also rose on favorable inflation comments from Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, suggesting they may favor a pause in Fed rate hikes. Gains in gold are limited as fund liquidation of long gold holdings weighs on gold prices after long gold holdings in ETFs fell to a new 3-year low last Friday. Also, hawkish comments from ECB President Lagarde were bearish for precious metals when she said the ECB could raise interest rates again, even if it pauses at its next meeting in September.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the scientific instrument maker had gained 8.77% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.14% in that time. Investors will be hoping for strength from Agilent Technologies as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 15, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.37, up 2.24% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.66 billion, down 3.56% from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.61 per share and revenue of $6.99 billion, which would represent changes of +7.47% and +2.07%, respectively, from the prior year. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Agilent Technologies should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

Arguably, healthcare is part of that group. That’s saying something when considering that is the sector is the second-largest behind technology in the S&P 500. Part of the issue confounding healthcare stocks this year is that the cap-weighted version of the S&P 500 Health Care Index is pointing lower. Meanwhile, more glamorous fare (growth sectors) and the broader market are soaring. Some of that boils down to lethargy among large-cap biopharma stocks. Still, some analysts remain encouraged by the long-term outlook for the sector. The Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Health Care ETF (RSPH) could be one of the ideal exchange traded funds with which to access a potential healthcare rebound in the second half of 2023 owing to the fund’s exposure to the sector’s defensive, growth, and quality traits. As things stand today, RSPH is sharply outperforming its cap-weighted rivals year-to-date while sporting less annualized volatility than the S&P 500. RSPH Ready for Healthy Second Half The healthcare sector is home to a plethora of wide moat companies, and RSPH in particular has them in spades. Wide moat traits include intangible assets, high switching costs, cost advantages, efficient scale, and the network effect. Broadly speaking, the network effect is more relevant in the tech and internet realms. However, the other four wide moat attributes are widely visible in the healthcare arena, including among RSPH member firms. That includes Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). “Pfizer’s patent-protected drugs carry strong pricing power that enables the firm to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital,” observed Morningstar sector director Damien Conover. “The patents give the company time to develop the next generation of drugs before generic competition arises.” RSPH’s exposure to medical device makers, which account for nearly 32% of the ETF’s portfolio, is another wide moat positive thanks to the likes of Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO), and Waters (NYSE: WAT). The Invesco ETF carries an allocation to this group 1,100 basis points over those found in equivalent cap-weighted ETFs.

These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.47% and +2.04%, respectively. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Agilent Technologies. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

(Symbol: CAH): Encompass Health Corp (Symbol: EHC): In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.

This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.77% for Agilent Technologies, Inc., 2.15% for Cardinal Health, Inc., and 0.91% for Encompass Health Corp.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised. There are 10 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Alcoa Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $25.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $46.00. The standard deviation is $6.995. But the whole reason to look at the average AA price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AA crossing above that average target price of $30.60/share, investors in AA have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $30.60 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On October 18, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of October 31, 2023 received the payment on November 17, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $25.12 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.59%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.69%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.09 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.10. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 877 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 3 owner(s) or 0.34% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 3.28%.

Japan is Asia's biggest importer of the metal and the premiums for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price CMAL0 set the benchmark for the region. The figure is lower than the $97 per tonPREM-ALUM-JPpaid in October to December, which was down 24% from the prior quarter, and is the lowest since the January-March quarter this year. The quarterly pricing negotiations began late last month between Japanese buyers and global suppliers, including Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX and South32 Ltd S32.AX, and are expected to continue until later this month. The initial offer of $95 came from one global producer, while another supplier indicated a similar level although it was not an offer, a source at a Japanese trading house said. ""But buyers are demanding lower levels as spot premiums are hovering at around $80 amid dull demand and as Japanese companies want to reduce inventories ahead of the end of the financial year in March,"" the source said. Aluminium stocks at three major Japanese ports AL-STK-JPPRT stood at 377,200 tonnes at the end of October, above 287,100 tonnes a year earlier, according to Marubeni Corp 8002.T. Reflecting sluggish demand, Japan's shipment of aluminium sheets and extrusions fell 1.4% in October on year, marking the 20th consecutive month of decline, data of the Japan Aluminium Association shows. Weakening premiums amid slack demand in Europe and the United States were also behind the buyers' requests for lower Japan premiums, another source at a local aluminium rolling mill said. The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the discussions.

For the SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF (Symbol: MDYV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $75.92 per unit. With MDYV trading at a recent price near $66.15 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.76% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MDYV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), Greif Inc (Symbol: GEF), and Gentex Corp. (Symbol: GNTX). Although AA has traded at a recent price of $26.22/share, the average analyst target is 16.90% higher at $30.65/share.

The European Commission on Wednesday proposed a new package of sanctions against Moscow, including a ban on imports of diamonds and liquid petroleum gas from Russia. It also included limited bans on aluminium products, such as wires, tubes and pipes, but these only make up 12% of EU aluminium imports from Russia, the group said in a statement.

EU members are currently debating a European Commission proposal for a 12th package of sanctions set to include import bans for diamonds and liquefied propane and measures designed to tighten implementation of a price cap on Russian oil. It also includes bans on aluminium wires, tubes and pipes, but these only make up 12% of EU aluminium imports from Russia, European Aluminium said in a statement.

EU industry has already started to phase out Russian aluminium, with January-August imports down by a third from the same period in 2022, based on European Aluminium data. For ingots, Russia represented 9% of all EU imports, compared with 25% in previous years. In the first nine months of this year, EU imported almost 500,000 metric tons of Russian aluminium and aluminium products worth 1.26 billion euros ($1.37 billion), according to Eurostat data. For 2022, imports were worth 2.84 billion euros.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 431 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new January 2025 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $22.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.75. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $22.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $18.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $24.57/share today. Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 16.67% return on the cash commitment, or 14.11% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $22.50 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $25.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $24.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $25.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 24.75% if the stock gets called away at the January 2025 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $25.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $25.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 38%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 23.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.47% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. The implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 50%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $24.57) to be 49%.

The proposed changes to the EU's ""electricity market design"" are a response to the spike in European power prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They will, according to Spain's Energy Minister Teresa Ribera, mean that ""consumers across the EU will be able to benefit from much more stable prices of energy, less dependency on the price of fossil fuels and better protection from future crises"". But will it be enough to save Europe's struggling industrial metals production sector? The brutal reality is that half of the region's primary aluminium and zinc capacity and almost a third of its silicon capacity is currently offline due to high power prices. The immediate impact comes with potential future impact as well. Producers are reluctant to invest in the new metals capacity needed to achieve Europe's self-sufficiency goals because they can't model power prices over the time-frame to build a new mine or smelter. ""We need bold action to get out of a dead-end street,"" was the stark warning from Bernard Respaut, head of the European Copper Institute (ECI), speaking at a debate on Europe's power crisis jointly hosted with industry association Eurometaux. LIGHT-TOUCH REFORM European power prices have fallen a long way from their 2022 peaks, when the region was still reeling from the reduction in Russian gas supplies. However, they are by no means back to levels trading before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and that isn't going to change any time soon. Wholesale pricing will continue to be determined on a pay-as-clear model, where bidding goes from the cheapest to the most expensive source, which tends to be gas. It's just that it's now LNG rather than Russian gas that sets the price. EU member states were deeply split on proposals for more fundamental reform of Europe's power market to allow for a complete break of the gas-power price linkage. The hard-won compromise keeps the existing market mechanism, which its supporters claim is more efficient than other models in a liberalised electricity market. Rather, the focus will be on longer-term price stabilisers such as power purchase agreements (PPA) between generators and users and two-way contracts for difference (CFD) for investment in new green generation. THE PPA PROBLEM U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa AA.N is a poster child for Europe's PPA model, using it to help secure the long-term future of its San Ciprian smelter in Spain. The company has PPAs with local power suppliers Endesa ELE.MC and Greenalia covering around 75% of the smelter's base load power when it returns from care and maintenance next year. Alcoa has the advantage of being in Spain, which has been aggressively building out renewable energy capacity and has Europe's most developed PPA market. The country is Europe's third highest renewable energy generator, much of it solar, and has by far the highest PPA contract capacity at a current 4.2 gigawatts, according to the European Commission. (""The development of renewable energy in the electricity market"", June 2023). Others are not so fortunate. ""We can't buy a PPA because it's not available on the market,"" Mats Gustavsson, head of energy at Swedish base metals producer Boliden BOL.ST, told the Eurometaux meeting. With limited forward liquidity in the company's local Nordpool power market, ""no-one's willing to take the risk on a fixed-term PPA"", he said. Even if the local market structure allows for PPAs, many smaller companies struggle to pass the credit tests needed to sign what can be as long as a 10-year contract. Moreover, many power suppliers will only offer PPAs on a pay-as-produced basis rather than the base-load structure that metal producers would prefer. The EU reform package is intended to iron out some of these problems by, for example, mandating member states to ensure guarantee schemes for smaller companies looking to enter PPAs. But it offers neither short-term relief for Europe's many mothballed production facilities nor the levels of certainty needed to build the next generation of mines and processing plants. STRATEGIC DIALOGUE Europe's focus on the longer-term solution, pivoting towards cheaper renewable energy, leaves untouched the immediate problem of tying spot power pricing to a volatile gas market. The bloc's power prices have historically been twice those of the U.S., but are now three or four times higher. Metals producers are not only having to adjust to currently high electricity costs, but face even higher costs as they seek their own pathway to net zero. The danger is that the cost of going green ""is going to kill us"", Gustavsson said. Boliden, it's worth noting, has just shuttered its Tara zinc-lead mine in Ireland at least partly due to high energy costs. The answer, according to the ECI's Respaut, is to take a more comprehensive approach to Europe's industrial base and connect the disparate dots of critical metals production, renewable energy and power pricing. Europe has to decide which strategic sectors it wants to keep and what it needs to do to help them not just survive but thrive. And it needs to do so sooner rather than later.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $23.41 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.71%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.67%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.03 standard deviations above the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.10. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 885 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 83 owner(s) or 8.57% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 21.91%. Total shares owned by institutions decreased in the last three months by 15.85% to 165,087K shares. The put/call ratio of AA is 1.26, indicating a bearish outlook. What are Other Shareholders Doing?

Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $24.00 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.67%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.67%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.00 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.08.

A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Alcoa (AA) came out with a quarterly loss of $1.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.13. This compares to loss of $0.33 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.89%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of 40.68%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Alcoa, which belongs to the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.6 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.42%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.85 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Alcoa shares have lost about 38.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 13.9%. What's Next for Alcoa? While Alcoa has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.29 on $2.7 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$1.79 on $10.68 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

In truth, we’ve been seeing Q3 reports come in dribs and drabs previously this week and before. Traditionally, earnings season didn’t kick off until Alcoa (AA) reported, but they’re not scheduled until next Wednesday. In any case, we’re happy we’re here; we can finally get a good glimpse at how the past quarter went, and how the full year is expected to finish. Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted Q3 earnings of $4.33 per share, nicely surpassing the $3.89 in the Zacks consensus for an +11.3% positive earnings surprise — and its fifth-straight bottom-line beat. Revenues of $39.87 billion in the quarter outperformed expectations by +1.9%, helping solidify its leadership status of the biggest Wall Street banks. Citigroup (C) also beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning for its Q3, with earnings of $1.63 per share coming in ahead of the $1.26 analysts were looking for on $20.4 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $19.32 billion anticipated. Both Institutional and Wealth Management outperformed expectations in the quarter, and shares are up +2.6% on the news. Wells Fargo (WFC) made it a trifecta this morning, outpacing expectations on both earnings and revenues. The company reported $1.39 per share — nicely above the $1.25 Zacks consensus and the $1.30 per share posted in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues of $20.86 billion in the quarter beat estimates by a cool +3.18%. Shares are up +2.4% in pre-market trading at this hour, nearly bring shares back to break-even for the year.] The September Import Price Index this morning came in well below expectations: +0.1% versus +0.5% consensus, which was also the previous month’s print. It’s the smallest move on import prices since June. Stripping out volatile petrol (fuel oil/gasoline), this figure drops to -0.3% — lower than the -0.1% anticipated and the lowest result since June of 2022. Year over year came in -1.7% for the eighth straight down-month. It’s worse than the -1.4% expected, but the closest to break-even since February. Exports came in +0.7% month over month. Its -4.1% year over year is pretty much in-line with analyst expectations, and an improvement from the downwardly revised -5.7% the previous month. This is the sixth-straight month lower on export prices, year over year. After today’s open, we’ll see Consumer Sentiment for October, expected to tick down to 67.4 from 68.1 reported last month.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Alcoa (AA) ended the recent trading session at $26.58, demonstrating a -1.19% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.5%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.23%. Shares of the bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company witnessed a loss of 10.9% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Industrial Products sector with its loss of 2% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.4%. The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alcoa in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on October 18, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Alcoa to post earnings of -$1.13 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 242.42%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.59 billion, down 9.11% from the year-ago period. Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of -$1.79 per share and revenue of $10.68 billion, indicating changes of -137.06% and -14.21%, respectively, compared to the previous year. It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Alcoa. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability. Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system. The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 27.27% lower. Alcoa presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Metal Products - Distribution industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 102, placing it within the top 41% of over 250 industries. The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Alcoa Corporation AA is scheduled to release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 18, after market close. The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the preceding four quarters, while missing in the other two. The average miss was 192.1%. Let’s see how things have shaped up for Alcoa this earnings season. Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote Factors to Note Alcoa’s third-quarter results are expected to be hurt by lower alumina production due to curtailment of production in the Kwinana refinery, reduced production in Australian refineries and unplanned equipment maintenance at the Alumar refinery. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for alumina production indicates a 1% dip from the year-ago reported number. Despite an anticipated increase in shipments due to increased trading activity, lower production may weigh on Alumina segment’s third-party sales in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for Alumina segment’s third-party sales implies an approximate 8% decline from the year-ago reported number. The Aluminum segment is expected to put up a weak show on softer billet demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-party Aluminum segment sales suggests a 14.5% decline from the third-quarter 2022 reported figure. However, raw material and production costs are likely to support AA’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.13. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Alcoa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q2 Earnings In second-quarter 2023, Alcoa incurred an adjusted loss of 35 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 59 cents. The company’s revenues of $2.68 billion outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.16%. Both the top and bottom lines declined year over year. Stocks to Consider Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season: Stanley Black & Decker SWK has an Earnings ESP of +3.20% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 27. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Stanley Black pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 47.2%, on average. The stock has gained 8.2% in a year. Tenaris TS has an Earnings ESP of +3.32% and a Zacks Rank #3.

We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.63 billion, marginally ahead of the consensus estimates of $2.59 billion. While this would mark a 2% decline sequentially, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 12%. We estimate that the company will post a net loss of about -$0.90 per share, slightly better than the consensus, although this would mark a decline from last year. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter. We note that AA stock has had a Sharpe Ratio of 0.2 since early 2017, which is lower than 0.5 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. This compares with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds. Aluminum prices have been weak over the last few months, amid improving supply trends, particularly in China, driven by more relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Moreover, there have been concerns about the real estate market in China, leading to slower demand from the construction sector. That said, the country could be seeing higher investment in the electrical grid and vehicle production. Moreover, orders from the automotive market, particularly in Europe and North America, are likely strong as the semiconductor shortage eased, helping production. While aluminum prices stood at about $2,400 in early April, they have declined since then to about $2,200 per ton currently. This is likely to impact the company’s revenues for the quarter. Separately, Alcoa has seen some delays in getting approvals for bauxite mining in Australia and this has resulted in the company mining for lower bauxite grades from previously approved areas as of Q2. This could also impact results to an extent, as production costs for these grades will be higher. However, the company could see production costs ease a bit for alumina and aluminum as prices for certain inputs such as caustic soda, and calcined petroleum coke ease. Overall, we still remain positive on AA stock despite the year-over-year decline in the company’s performance. Alcoa stock remains down almost 40% year-to-date and this could be a compelling entry point. Rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet and also due to the fact that its facilities are based mainly in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $39 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price of about $29.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -215.2%. Revenues are expected to be $2.59 billion, down 9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa? For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.29%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +40.68%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $27.16 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.47%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.66%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.17 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 893 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 78 owner(s) or 8.03% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 21.75%.

And there are lots of great stocks available right now at decent prices. Many stocks are downright cheap. This has led to investors looking for long-term stocks. Investors looking to take positions in well-managed companies that have a history of rewarding their stockholders can find plenty of opportunities in the current market.

The key is to look for opportunities, buy with conviction, and hold for the long term. Dillard’s (DDS) Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com For all its success, you’d think that the upscale American department store chain Dillard’s (NYSE:DDS) would get more attention. Sadly, no. But the company that continues to be run by the same Dillard family that founded it back in 1938 during the Great Depression has a remarkable track record. While DDS stock is flat this year, it has gained 325% over the last five years, outpacing many technology stocks over the same period of time. Dillard’s has achieved success mainly through careful family stewardship that emphasizes slow and steady growth and places a premium on two-way loyalty between management and employees. With fewer than 300 stores in 29 states, Dillard’s is no Walmart (NYSE:WMT). However, the company’s measured approach and focus on providing customers with a positive shopping experience has led to success. DDS stock looks affordable right now trading at only six times future earnings. It also pays a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. Alcoa (AA) Source: shutterstock.com/MOLPIX Aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has struggled mightily in recent years. AA stock is down 34% this year, including a 25% decline over the last 12 months. However, hope arrives at the beaten-down company in the form of a new chief executive officer (CEO). The Pittsburgh-based company just announced that William Oplinger has succeeded Roy Harvey as CEO. Alcoa added that Harvey will remain on as a strategic adviser until the end of this year to help with the transition. Oplinger had previously served as Alcoa’s chief operations officer and knows the company intimately. The previous CEO, Roy Harvey, had been at Alcoa’s helm since November 2016, which is when the aluminum maker went public. Alcoa didn’t discuss the CEO change, saying only in a written statement that the executive shake-up is part of its “succession planning process.” However, the leadership change comes ahead of Alcoa reporting its Q3 financial results in mid-October. While it might take some time, a new CEO could help to get AA stock moving back in the right direction after a long period of underperformance. Alcoa’s stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share. Costco (COST) Source: Shutterstock Big box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) continues to thrive and just reported strong financial results that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The company is benefitting from strong grocery sales even as consumers cut back on discretionary and big-ticket items such as furniture and electronics at its stores. Drawn by more affordable groceries, traffic at Costco stores worldwide rose 5.2% and gained 5% within the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the company’s most recent quarter. Investors and analysts continue to hold out hope for two developments at Costco, both of which could transpire in Q4 of this year. The first is a long-awaited membership fee hike. The last time Costco raised its membership fees was in 2017. Analysts say it is only a matter of time before the company acquiesces and lifts it membership tiers. The second event is a special dividend payment. The last such payment to stockholders occurred during the pandemic. A strong finish to the year could provide management with the impetus to reward shareholders. COST stock is up 25% this year and has increased 158% over the last five years.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $29.38 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.36%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.66%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.26 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 882 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 146 owner(s) or 14.20% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 27.91%.

Don?t Ignore These 2 Industrial Products Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-these-2-industrial-products-stocks-set-to-beat-earnings-5,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. Hunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool. The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb. Bringing together a positive earnings ESP alongside a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has helped stocks report a positive earnings surprise 70% of the time. Furthermore, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest. Most stocks, about 60%, fall into the #3 (Hold) category, and they are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with a #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market, with Strong Buy stocks outperforming more than any other rank. Should You Consider Alcoa? Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Alcoa (AA) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.79 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2023. Alcoa's Earnings ESP sits at +4.05%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.79 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.82. AA is also part of a large group of stocks that boast a positive ESP. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. AA is part of a big group of Industrial Products stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Rockwell Automation (ROK) as well. Rockwell Automation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2023. ROK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.54 a share 44 days from its next earnings release. Rockwell Automation's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +1.4% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49. AA and ROK's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon. Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.57% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.04%. Heading into today, shares of the bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company had lost 9.61% over the past month, lagging the Industrial Products sector's loss of 1.68% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.64% in that time. Investors will be hoping for strength from Alcoa as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Alcoa is projected to report earnings of -$0.82 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 148.48%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.62 billion, down 8.15% from the prior-year quarter. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of -$1.25 per share and revenue of $10.67 billion. These totals would mark changes of -125.88% and -14.29%, respectively, from last year. Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alcoa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || This year has not been a good one for aluminum prices (ALU23). The aluminum futures benchmark on the London Metal Exchange has fallen nearly a fifth since its January peak, and more than 40% from last year’s highs — largely due to economic weakness in Europe and the U.S., and poor construction demand in China. The benchmark three-month future contract on the LME is currently about $2,180 a metric ton, down from more than $3,840 a ton at last year’s peak. This slump in aluminum prices this year is reflecting the long-awaited, but yet-to-materialize global economic slowdown. Used in everything from buildings, beverage cans, solar panels, automobiles and airplanes, aluminum prices are often a proxy for expected industrial activity. With aluminum trading at levels last seen in early 2021, it may be “nearing a bottom,” according to producers and industry analysts, who are growing increasingly bullish about demand over the medium term for the metal from quickly growing clean technologies. These technologies include electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels. Demand from the solar market is particularly strong at the moment. Solar farms typically use aluminum for frames and mounting solar panels. Electric vehicles also require more aluminum than traditional internal combustion engine cars. The Aluminum Market Now Aluminum prices this month experienced their largest contango since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Contango means that aluminum bought currently is at a discount to the futures prices for aluminum. This reflects weak spot (immediate) demand, as well as the expectation that future prices will be higher than today. Estimates are that there is currently a global surplus of just over 800,000 metric tons this year, and that is weighing on the price. But there are also signs that the gloomy fog over aluminum is beginning to lift, as a period of running down global aluminum inventories appears to be coming to an end.Surprisingly to some, China has actually been a bright spot for aluminum demand. That’s due to the fact that rapidly growing spending on clean energy infrastructure is more than making up for slumping demand from the highly indebted Chinese property sector. Graeme Train, head of metals research at trading house Trafigura (one of the world’s largest metals traders), told the Financial Times that “Chinese demand is running at a record high.” In July, China’s imports of aluminum rose 20% compared with a year earlier. However, that positive is being partially offset by China’s domestic production of aluminum, which is close to a record high. Add up all the factors, and the outlook for aluminum looks much more interesting - over the medium term - than it has been for a long time. One way to participate in aluminum’s upside potential is by purchasing Alcoa (AA) stock. Let’s take a closer look at the company. Alcoa Outlook Alcoa, founded in 1888, is one of the world’s largest aluminum producers. It is a vertically integrated aluminum company that is comprised of bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production (smelting and casting), and energy generation. The company has 27 operating locations (through direct and indirect ownership) in 9 countries on 6 continents, situated primarily in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Spain, and the U.S. Alcoa's assets include the largest bauxite mining portfolio in the world, a globally-diverse alumina refining system, and an aluminum smelting portfolio. The company is one of the world’s largest bauxite miners, with access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend (in most cases) more than 20 years. Alcoa has ownership in seven active bauxite mines globally, four of which it operates, that are strategically located near key Atlantic and Pacific markets. This includes the Huntly mine in Australia, which the second largest bauxite mine in the world. Alcoa is also the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China, with a highly competitive cost curve position. It has seven refineries on four continents, including one of the world’s largest alumina production facilities, the Pinjarra refinery in Western Australia. In addition to supplying its aluminum smelters with high-quality feedstock, AA also has significant alumina sales to third parties, with around two thirds of production being sold externally. Alcoa’s stock is down 45% over the past year and 37.6% year-to-date. The shares have sold off over lower aluminum prices and the related fears of a steep global recession, and now trade just over $28. www.barchart.com Even if Alcoa stock goes back to $35 a share, it would imply an EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ratio) of 4.8 times its 2024 EBITDA estimate. That’s in line with its three-year average forward EV/EBITDA - but a discount to its peers, which trade at an average of 7.5 times. Given Alcoa’s compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, I am confident in the company, as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition. AA can be bought anywhere below $30 a share. On the date of publication, Tony Daltorio did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new October 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of 97 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $26.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $25.03 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.21/share today. Because the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.73% return on the cash commitment, or 27.23% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $26.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.31. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $28.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $30.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.99% if the stock gets called away at the October 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $30.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.64% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.21) to be 57%.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $28.48 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.40%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.65%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.21 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. Alcoa Background Information (This description is provided by the company.)

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new October 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $28.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.37. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $28.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $26.63 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $28.83/share today. Because the $28.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.89% return on the cash commitment, or 41.53% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $28.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $29.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.89. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $28.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $29.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.15% if the stock gets called away at the October 6th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $29.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $29.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.65% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $28.83) to be 57%.

The company booked a $1.175 billion impairment charge against its two Australian alumina refineries in its second-quarter results. This is in part down to what Rio Tinto called ""challenging market conditions"" for alumina, which is refined from bauxite and then fed into a smelter for conversion into metal. But it is also down to the cost of decarbonising two of the company's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. The short-term cost comes in the form of Australia's new carbon tax on big industrial operators. The long-term problem is the dependence of both Rio's alumina refineries and aluminium smelters on a national power grid that is largely driven by coal and gas. Such is the aluminium paradox. A metal that is core to the green energy transition comes with a heavy carbon footprint, the sector accounting for around 2% of all man-made emissions every year. CARBON PROBLEMS Rio Tinto has conceded it is unlikely to meet its 15% target for reducing group emissions by 2025 without buying carbon credits, although it remains committed to its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. The company's biggest carbon headache is its aluminium business, which last year accounted for 21.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions out of a group total of 30.3 million metric tons. Rio's Canadian smelter network draws power from Quebec's hydro-electric system, meaning its Atlantic operations generated 4.8 million metric tons of carbon equivalent last year, half the amount produced by its Pacific operations, according to Rio's 2022 sustainability report. The two Pacific region refineries, Queensland Aluminium (QAL) and Yarwun, with combined alumina production last year of 6.4 million metric tons, are responsible for half of Rio's Scope 1 direct emissions in Australia. Together with the company's three power-hungry smelters, the Australian operations represent around half of the group's direct and Scope 2 emissions, which include the carbon footprint of energy used in the aluminium production process. WRITE-DOWNS Rio's impairment charge, which comes in at $828 million after tax, comprises a complete write-down of the Yarwun refinery and a $227 million impairment of the QAL plant. The company is evaluating a major capital investment project at QAL aimed at boosting efficiency and cutting emissions. If the so-called ""double digestion"" project doesn't go ahead, the operation will also be fully written down, Rio said. The trigger for the write-down is the Australian government's revised Safeguard Mechanism, which came into force in July. It sets carbon caps on some of the country's biggest emitters, forcing them to pay for carbon offsets if they breach the upper threshold. That imposes extra costs on a business in which ""we're actually not really making money"", Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm told analysts on the company's quarterly results call. The baseline for calculating the carbon caps will decline by 4.9% each year until 2030, which the government hopes will allow companies time to decarbonise their operations. Rio has won some concessions from the government on the basis that its aluminium assets are a strategic part of the country's industrial profile, but its two refineries have still not escaped the negative financial impact. GRID-LOCK As well as looking at an upgrade at QAL, Rio has partnered with Japan's Sumitomo Corp on a project to use hydrogen rather than natural gas at Yarwun. The pilot plant will produce around 6,000 metric tons of alumina per year while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 3,000 metric tons per year. This, however, is experimental technology and doesn't provide an immediate solution to the bigger problem of decarbonising Australia's grid. The country's six alumina refineries were 93% dependent on coal or gas power in 2021, according to the International Aluminium Institute. Rio's three smelters and the Portland plant, majority owned by U.S. producer Alcoa AA.N, are equally tied to fossil fuel power. The scale of converting the existing grid to renewable energy is daunting. Switching Rio's operations to wind or solar would mean building a renewable energy park 12 times larger than anything so far constructed in Australia, according to Stausholm. ""So it's not something you just solve from one day to another,"" he told analysts. LONG-TERM THREAT Rio is pursuing multiple paths towards greener aluminium in its North American operations. It has partnered with Alcoa on producing aluminium using inert cathode technology, which will reduce Scope 1 emissions in the smelting process. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells has begun at the company's Alma smelter in Canada with operations due to begin this year. Capacity at the low-carbon AP60 smelter, also in Quebec, will be expanded by 160,000 metric tons per year, with commissioning expected in 2026. Rio is investing heavily in recycled aluminium, which can be remelted using just 5% of the power needed to produce virgin metal. The company has just announced a joint venture with Giampaolo Group, one of North America's largest secondary aluminium operators, with the capacity to produce 900,000 metric tons a year of recycled metal. But its Australian operations are going to remain a significant brake on the company's journey towards a lower carbon future. Rio views the business as ""critical"" to its wider portfolio, according to Peter Cunningham, the company's chief financial officer. It is also critical to Australia, not just because of its size but because, as Stausholm pointed out, it is ""a business that can underwrite a lot of renewable energy"". ""But if we can't get firm renewable energy at a competitive price, it's going to be impossible for us to manufacture and export aluminium out of Australia,"" he warned. Rio's predicament neatly encapsulates the power paradox facing aluminium producers everywhere. Going green needs green energy, and there's not enough of it around right now.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $36.19 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.11%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.64%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.46 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. For more in-depth coverage of Alcoa, view the free, crowd-sourced company research report on Finpedia. What is the Fund Sentiment?

The company booked a $1.175 billion impairment charge against its two Australian alumina refineries in its second-quarter results. This is in part down to what Rio Tinto called ""challenging market conditions"" for alumina, which is refined from bauxite and then fed into a smelter for conversion into metal. But it is also down to the cost of decarbonising two of the company's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. The short-term cost comes in the form of Australia's new carbon tax on big industrial operators. The long-term problem is the dependence of both Rio's alumina refineries and aluminium smelters on a national power grid that is largely driven by coal and gas. Such is the aluminium paradox. A metal that is core to the green energy transition comes with a heavy carbon footprint, the sector accounting for around 2% of all man-made emissions every year. CARBON PROBLEMS Rio Tinto has conceded it is unlikely to meet its 15% target for reducing group emissions by 2025 without buying carbon credits, although it remains committed to its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. The company's biggest carbon headache is its aluminium business, which last year accounted for 21.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions out of a group total of 30.3 million metric tons. Rio's Canadian smelter network draws power from Quebec's hydro-electric system, meaning its Atlantic operations generated 4.8 million metric tons of carbon equivalent last year, half the amount produced by its Pacific operations, according to Rio's 2022 sustainability report. The two Pacific region refineries, Queensland Aluminium (QAL) and Yarwun, with combined alumina production last year of 6.4 million metric tons, are responsible for half of Rio's Scope 1 direct emissions in Australia. Together with the company's three power-hungry smelters, the Australian operations represent around half of the group's direct and Scope 2 emissions, which include the carbon footprint of energy used in the aluminium production process. WRITE-DOWNS Rio's impairment charge, which comes in at $828 million after tax, comprises a complete write-down of the Yarwun refinery and a $227 million impairment of the QAL plant. The company is evaluating a major capital investment project at QAL aimed at boosting efficiency and cutting emissions. If the so-called ""double digestion"" project doesn't go ahead, the operation will also be fully written down, Rio said. The trigger for the write-down is the Australian government's revised Safeguard Mechanism, which came into force in July. It sets carbon caps on some of the country's biggest emitters, forcing them to pay for carbon offsets if they breach the upper threshold. That imposes extra costs on a business in which ""we're actually not really making money"", Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm told analysts on the company's quarterly results call. The baseline for calculating the carbon caps will decline by 4.9% each year until 2030, which the government hopes will allow companies time to decarbonise their operations. Rio has won some concessions from the government on the basis that its aluminium assets are a strategic part of the country's industrial profile, but its two refineries have still not escaped the negative financial impact. GRID-LOCK As well as looking at an upgrade at QAL, Rio has partnered with Japan's Sumitomo Corp on a project to use hydrogen rather than natural gas at Yarwun. The pilot plant will produce around 6,000 metric tons of alumina per year while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 3,000 metric tons per year. This, however, is experimental technology and doesn't provide an immediate solution to the bigger problem of decarbonising Australia's grid. The country's six alumina refineries were 93% dependent on coal or gas power in 2021, according to the International Aluminium Institute. Rio's three smelters and the Portland plant, majority owned by U.S. producer Alcoa AA.N, are equally tied to fossil fuel power. The scale of converting the existing grid to renewable energy is daunting. Switching Rio's operations to wind or solar would mean building a renewable energy park 12 times larger than anything so far constructed in Australia, according to Stausholm. ""So it's not something you just solve from one day to another,"" he told analysts. LONG-TERM THREAT Rio is pursuing multiple paths towards greener aluminium in its North American operations. It has partnered with Alcoa on producing aluminium using inert cathode technology, which will reduce Scope 1 emissions in the smelting process. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells has begun at the company's Alma smelter in Canada with operations due to begin this year. Capacity at the low-carbon AP60 smelter, also in Quebec, will be expanded by 160,000 metric tons per year, with commissioning expected in 2026. Rio is investing heavily in recycled aluminium, which can be remelted using just 5% of the power needed to produce virgin metal. The company has just announced a joint venture with Giampaolo Group, one of North America's largest secondary aluminium operators, with the capacity to produce 900,000 metric tons a year of recycled metal. But its Australian operations are going to remain a significant brake on the company's journey towards a lower carbon future. Rio views the business as ""critical"" to its wider portfolio, according to Peter Cunningham, the company's chief financial officer. It is also critical to Australia, not just because of its size but because, as Stausholm pointed out, it is ""a business that can underwrite a lot of renewable energy"". ""But if we can't get firm renewable energy at a competitive price, it's going to be impossible for us to manufacture and export aluminium out of Australia,"" he warned. Rio's predicament neatly encapsulates the power paradox facing aluminium producers everywhere. Going green needs green energy, and there's not enough of it around right now.

Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $35.61 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.12%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.64%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%.

A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend On May 4, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of May 16, 2023 received the payment on June 2, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share. At the current share price of $32.68 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.22%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.63%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.16 (n=236). The current dividend yield is 0.35 standard deviations below the historical average. Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.06. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5. The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%. What is the Fund Sentiment? There are 1012 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 28 owner(s) or 2.69% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.23%, a decrease of 16.05%.

While Alcoa has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alcoa: mixed.

For the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (Symbol: XME), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $60.85 per unit. With XME trading at a recent price near $51.56 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.01% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of XME's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Uranium Energy Corp (Symbol: UEC), Peabody Energy Corp (Symbol: BTU), and Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA). Although UEC has traded at a recent price of $3.12/share, the average analyst target is 117.15% higher at $6.78/share. Similarly, BTU has 39.02% upside from the recent share price of $20.86 if the average analyst target price of $29.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AA to reach a target price of $43.30/share, which is 25.43% above the recent price of $34.52.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

On the negative side was a hawkish comment Thursday night from Fed Governor Waller, who said he sees two more +25 bp rate hikes this year.

In addition, the ongoing fund liquidation of gold is weighing on prices as holdings in gold ETFs fell to a 4-month low on Thursday. Precious metals have support from increased demand as an inflation hedge after the University of Michigan U.S. July inflation expectations indicator unexpectedly increased.

U.S. stock index futures this morning are moving higher as Q2 corporate earnings results begin to roll in. Strength in bank earnings is supporting the overall market as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are moving higher in pre-market trading on better-than-expected Q2 earnings. However, gains are muted as bond yields move higher on hawkish comments late Thursday from Fed Governor Waller, who said he sees two more +25 bp rate hikes this year. Late Thursday, Fed Governor Waller said, ""I see two more 25 bp interest rate hikes in the target range over the four remaining FOMC meetings this year as necessary to keep inflation moving toward our target."" Positive inflation news is also bullish for stocks after the U.S. Jun import price index ex-petroleum fell -0.3% m/m, a slightly larger decline than expectations of -0.2% m/m. While this week’s better-than-expected inflation and price reports are unlikely to dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates by 25 bp later this month, it increases the chances that this month’s rate hike could be the last rate hike in this cycle. The markets are discounting the odds at 91% for a +25 bp rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on July 25-26. The markets are anticipating a peak funds rate of 5.42% by November, which is +34 bp higher than the current effective federal funds rate of 5.08%. Global bond yields are mixed.

The Euro Stoxx 50 today is moderately higher. European stocks have support today from favorable inflation news after the German Jun wholesale price index posted its largest decline in 3 years. However, stock gains were limited by weakness in telecom companies, as Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB both fell more than -8% after issuing disappointing guidance because of weaker demand. Also, retailer stocks were weaker after Burberry Group Plc reported Q1 retail comparable sales rose +18%, slightly below expectations of +18.3%, as Q1 China comparable store sales rose less than expected. The German Jun wholesale price index fell -2.9% y/y, the largest decline in 3 years. China’s Shanghai Composite today climbed to a 3-1/2 week high and closed slightly higher. Strength in Chinese stocks related to artificial intelligence led the overall market higher after the government loosened some of the regulations it proposed for ChatGPT-style services, signaling the need for companies to compete for global leadership in artificial intelligence. The new 24 guidelines will be overseen by seven state agencies led by the Cyberspace Administration of China. Stocks also found support after China’s central bank signaled more policy support for the economy. Top officials of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said they have enough room to ease monetary policy if needed. PBOC Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said, ""We still have ample policy room to deal with unexpected challenges and changes."" Also, Zou Lan, head of the monetary policy department, said the PBOC will take policy steps on ""the needs of the economy and the price situation."" Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index today fell back from a 1-week high and closed slightly lower. Stocks came under pressure from economic concerns after Japan's May industrial production was revised lower. Also, strength in the yen weighed on exporter stocks after the yen rallied to a 1-3/4 month high against the dollar. Speculation that the BOJ may signal a policy change or tweak its yield curve control framework at its July 27-28 meeting has pushed government bond yields higher and boosted the yen. The 10-year JGB bond yield climbed to a 2-1/2 month high today at 0.485%. The Nikkei Stock Index today initially moved higher on strength in Japanese chip equipment and material suppliers after Nvidia rallied to a new record high Thursday on optimism about AI-related growth.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new September 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.99. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $36.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.01 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.04/share today. Because the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.53% return on the cash commitment, or 40.35% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost. Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $36.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $38.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.23. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $37.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $38.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.61% if the stock gets called away at the September 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $38.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $38.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.02% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.95% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.04) to be 58%.

We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.72 billion, marginally ahead of the consensus estimates. While this would be roughly flat on a sequential basis, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 17%. We estimate that the company will post a net loss of about -$0.30 per share, roughly in line with the consensus, although this would mark a sharp decline from last year. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter. Aluminum prices have been on the decline over the past few months, amid improving supply trends, particularly in China, driven by more relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Moreover, reports of the resumption of smelting operations in China’s Yunnan province in late June have also been weighing on the aluminum market. While aluminum prices stood at about $2,400 in early April, they have declined since then to about $2,150 per ton currently. This is likely to impact the company’s revenues for the quarter. Separately, Alcoa has seen some delays in getting approvals for bauxite mining in Australia and this has resulted in the company mining for lower bauxite grades from previously approved areas. This could also impact results to an extent. That said, things could pick up a bit in Europe. While Alcoa was facing headwinds due to the high price of natural gas, this is likely to have moderated a bit over the last two months as energy prices cooled. Although Alcoa has not provided specific guidance for Q2 2023, it expects to ship between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons of aluminum in 2023, consistent with 2022. Overall, we still remain positive on AA stock despite expectations of mixed results. Alcoa stock remains down almost 25% year-to-date and this could be a compelling entry point. Rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet and also due to the fact that its facilities are largely based in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $48 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price of about $34.

Oplinger and Alcoa Corporation, effective February 1, 2023 (filed herewith)* This story originally appeared on Fintel. The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Alcoa Corporation AA is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19, after market close. The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the preceding four quarters, while missing in the other two. The average miss was 201.6%. Let’s see how things have shaped up for Alcoa this earnings season. Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote Factors to Note Alcoa’s second-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by lower shipments of alumina and aluminum. Reduced refinery production is expected to have weighed on alumina shipments. An anticipated weakness in shipments due to lower trading activities and weak volumes from the Canadian smelters is likely to have hurt Aluminum segment’s third-party sales. Higher prices of aluminum and lower raw material and production costs might have partly offset the adversity. While alumina shipments are likely to reflect softness, higher average realized prices and strong volumes are expected to have driven the segment’s third-party sales. Lower raw material and energy costs are also expected to have aided the unit’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Alcoa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q1 Earnings Alcoa incurred an adjusted loss of 23 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported adjusted earnings of $3.06. Total revenues of $2.67 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.31%. The top line declined 18.8% year over year. Stocks to Consider Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season: Stanley Black & Decker SWK has an Earnings ESP of +12.23% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Stanley Black pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.3%, on average. The stock has rallied 22.6% in the past three months. Tenaris TS has an Earnings ESP of +6.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release second-quarter results on Aug 2. Tenaris delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.2%, on average. The stock has gained around 4% in the past three months.

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Alcoa (AA) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -118.7%. Revenues are expected to be $2.62 billion, down 28.1% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 64.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa? For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.23, delivering a surprise of -360%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. || By Andy Home LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - European Union (EU) countries have added aluminium to the list of minerals and metals covered by the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA). The Act is the centerpiece of the EU's strategy for ensuring it has the necessary inputs to compete with the United States and China in the global race to decarbonise. The initial omission of aluminium from the CRMA was greeted with outrage from parts of the industry, the Federation of Aluminium Consumers in Europe lambasting EU policy-makers for ""doing the opposite of what should be done"". The last-minute inclusion of the metal, together with its upstream feeds of bauxite and alumina, attests both to the criticality of aluminium to the green revolution and Europe's increasingly precarious security of supply. GREEN METAL Aluminium is already the second most widely used metal in modern society after steel thanks to its high strength-to-weight ratio. Usage is expected to grow strongly over the coming years as the energy transition gathers pace. The World Bank has identified aluminium as a ""high-impact"" and ""cross-cutting"" metal in all existing and potential green energy technologies from solar to geothermal. Moreover, aluminium will play an important role in light-weighting electric vehicles, allowing automakers to get more mileage out of lithium-ion batteries. Global demand is forecast by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI) to increase by almost 40% to 119.5 million metric tons by 2030, meaning the aluminium sector needs to produce an extra 33.3 million metric tons of metal over the decade. FALLING OUTPUT As things stand, Europe is going to struggle to lift primary production at all over that time-frame. Western European production has been sliding steadily over the last 15 years with run-rates dropping from over 4.5 million metric tons to a current 2.7 million. The sector has been squeezed between high European energy prices and years of high Chinese exports, largely in the form of semi-fabricated products. Aluminium smelters consume a lot of power and the sector has taken another hit from the energy crunch that has followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Europe lost another 850,000 tonnes of primary smelter capacity between October 2021 and March 2022, according to the EU. Some, such as Alcoa's AA.N Spanish plant, will return after new, lower-carbon power supplies are secured. Some may well never return. IMPORT DEPENDENCY European aluminium consumption averaged just over 5.0 million metric tons per year over the 2016-2020 period, according to the EU. Import reliance averaged 56% over the same period, which is much lower than the bloc's 89% import reliance for bauxite and probably the reason why EU planners didn't originally include aluminium in the CRMA. However, the key difference is where Europe sources its bauxite and primary aluminium. Imports of bauxite over the 2016-2020 period came primarily from Guinea (70%), Brazil (14%) and Sierra Leone (10%). Imports of primary aluminium, by contrast, were dominated by Russian metal, which accounted for an average 33% over the same five-year period, according to the EU. The next largest supplier was Mozambique, which accounted for 17% of total imports, followed by Iceland, which accounted for another 14%. Both the United States and Britain have imposed penal duties on imports of Russian metal but the importance of Russia to Europe's supply chain has meant there are no official European sanctions against Rusal, Russia's dominant producer. However, the dependence on Russian supply is highly problematic given the increased tensions between the EU and its eastern neighbour after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. If Russian supply were taken out of the import picture, Europe's aluminium dependence would become much more acute. POWER PROBLEMS Getting aluminium onto Europe's critical raw materials list is an important win for the region's aluminium sector. However, it's just the start. Preserving what remains of the bloc's primary smelting capacity, let alone rebuilding it, is dependent on low-cost power, something that the EU is running short of right now. The problem is compounded by aluminium producers' need to lower their carbon footprint. That requires lots of renewable power, something the region is even more short of. The EU's proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism is another bone of contention. The European aluminium industry fears it will raise the cost of imports while not having any impact on global emissions in an industry dominated by China. It's worth remembering that European processors are also paying import duties on both primary aluminium and alloy as a result of legacy attempts to protect the region's smelters. Those import duties have evidently only slowed not halted the steady decline in European smelter production. TARGETS The EU's CRMA sets 2030 self-sufficiency targets of 10% of the bloc's consumption for production, 20% for recycling and 50% for processing. The last two have just been raised from 15% and 40% respectively. In addition, no more than 65% of imports should come from any individual supplier. If the EU is going to meet all those targets for aluminium, it's going to need a holistic approach that includes affordable green power pricing, a re-think of its legacy import duties and a possible fine-tuning of the proposed carbon border mechanism to reflect the reality of the global aluminium sector. Putting it on the list of critical raw materials may be the easy part of that multi-dimensional challenge.

This downward trend has been a boon for US investors travelling to Europe on vacation. And whilst many have continued to focus their investment portfolios on US domestic stocks, the idea of actually owning international stocks has taken a back seat. This is ill advised, however, given that there are already early signs that the US dollar might be softening; indeed, the sterling has just risen to USD1.327 on the back of strong manufacturing data. Rather than overlook the vast array of opportunities that exist to hold securities in dynamic international companies, there is a viable solution: American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). These have long been used (since 1927) to allow US investors easy access to foreign companies without having to set up overseas brokerage accounts. Simply put, an ADR is a dollar-denominated certificate issued by a US depositary bank that represents a specific number of shares in a foreign company trading on a US stock exchange. “You can buy a foreign company’s stocks in the US without having to deal with currency issues. Also, the depositary bank issuing the ADR will convert dividend payments into US dollars and take care of any foreign tax issues,” says John Lewis, Senior Portfolio Manager at Dorsey, Wright & Associates (‘DWA’) a Nasdaq company that has been running a systematic momentum factor ADR strategy for the past decade. ADRs represent an ideal opportunity today for US investors to gain access to international markets such as the UK, which has been enjoying a surprising market rebound since Brexit, the FTSE 100 having exceeded 6,800. “There are a large number of developed and developing market companies that list ADRs across the capitalization spectrum; small cap through to large cap. It’s a wide dispersion of companies that do ADR listings. “Investors in the US, as well as those in Europe and Asia, have a home country bias when it comes to investing so getting international exposure, in general, is a good thing for investors to consider. Also, the US dollar has stopped heading northwards – when it was rising, of course the US stock markets were the only game in town for US investors as international markets underperformed on a relative basis. “But the US dollar has started to slow slightly and international markets to perform better. I think as the US dollar flattens out, international investments are going to look much more attractive to US investors,” remarks Lewis. To take full advantage of the opportunities on offer, DWA utilizes a smart beta strategy by focusing exclusively on momentum and trend so as to provide investors with a viable route to holding foreign stocks without the operational headaches associated with buying stocks on international exchanges. Indeed, the fact that ADRs are settled in US dollars is an ideal way to hedge against a slower US dollar growth, as investors get not only the capital gains of well-performing international stocks, they also benefit from the associated currency tailwind (i.e. a stronger sterling). “Our models have been picking up allocations in Latin American ADRs this year. That market has proven to be very good for us and there are plenty of good Latin American ADRs, which we’ve been adding as new positions in areas such as basic materials,” says Lewis. DWA’s investment model focuses on momentum signals to identify the best ADRs to hold in the strategy at any given time. The implication to this is that it holds the winners and drops the losers; something that behavioural biases implicit in human beings struggle to overcome. “Our international ADR strategy has been one of our best performing strategies over the past 10 years. I think one of the reasons for that is that the ADR market is very dynamic. There are a lot of interesting companies across the globe providing a wide dispersion of returns, and that’s very beneficial to our type of model,” says Lewis, who continues: “We don’t use any fundamental factors (valuations, earnings, analyst revisions); our model is based purely on market price movement. The model looks at a universe of 400 to 500 ADRs and ranks them based on momentum scores every day. It is a very systematic and disciplined process. We hold anywhere in the region of 30 to 40 ADRs in the strategy. We have a very strict sell discipline. Once an ADR falls below a pre-determined rank we sell it and buy the strongest momentum ADR that we don’t currently hold in the portfolio.” That the model is market price data-driven is quite unique in the ADR space. It means that Lewis and his team can objectively look at large numbers of international companies and place them all on the same footing. Given that there are tremendous variations in respect to currency fluctuations, political developments etc. that one has to be mindful of, when trading international ADRs, by focusing on market price the DWA model is able to analyse companies in different economic cycles. “We look at the ADR universe every day. If there’s a major move in the global markets we will immediately sell ADRs that are losing momentum and replace them with something stronger. Turnover in the portfolio tends to be lumpy. When there are major changes in leadership – i.e. country leadership, sector leadership – there tends to be more trading activity. Since we are a trend following strategy, as long as that leadership is sustainable there may be long periods where we are not doing a lot of trading. Our strategy is quite unique in that way. We’re not doing a full rebalance every month or quarter.” Such has been the success of its momentum approach that AdvisorShares, a leading sponsor of actively managed ETFs, announced on 30th August 2016 that it had selected Dorsey, Wright & Associates as sub-advisor to the AdvisorShares WCM/BNY Mellon Focused Growth ADR ETF (AADR). “Dorsey, Wright and Associate’s well-established expertise and track record of industry-leading technical investing is evident, particularly in their international equity approach that will be employed in AADR,” said Noah Hamman, Chief Executive Officer of AdvisorShares. DWA’s model has shown that the momentum factor can be highly successful when applied to the ADR market. Lewis cites a couple of reasons for why this is so: “Firstly, it makes it very quick and objective for us to analyse a large set of companies that exist under different circumstances. It’s just as easy for us to look at a consumer staples company in the UK as it is a gold mining company in South Africa. Using that kind of objective measure for investors is very valuable. “Secondly, as referred to previously, there is a wide dispersion of performance in global ADRs. A particular ADR may perform very well one year and less so the next. That dispersion profile is perfect for us because we can focus on areas of the globe doing well and totally exclude those that are underperforming.” To conclude, Lewis says that rather than thinking about momentum in isolation, investors could consider using a strategy such as DWA’s in tandem with a value factor strategy. “If you use a momentum strategy like ours, and find a manager that is very good on the valuation side, by combining those two strategies the excess returns are negatively correlated; in other words, they outperform at different parts of the cycle. Mixing those two factors together can be additive and that is what US investors have been increasingly doing over the last few years.” With different parts of the global economy growing at different rates, gaining exposure to ADRs through a smart beta strategy such as DWA’s is proving to be an increasingly compelling consideration. If the dollar weakens, US investors will need solutions.
